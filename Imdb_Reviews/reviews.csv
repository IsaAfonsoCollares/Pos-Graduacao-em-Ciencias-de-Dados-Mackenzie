A Brazilian masterwork,TheLittleSongbird,10 June 2017,10,"Such an amazing film that deserves the accolades and acclaimed hype it's garnered. One of the best foreign language films there is and one of the best films personally seen recently, after a long time of being on my to see list but taking a while to get round to it due to being so busy and going through a difficult phase."
The Godfather of Rio,SnoopyStyle,16 June 2015,8,"Li'l Zé and his gang is having fun chasing a runaway chicken in a Rio favela called the Cidade de Deus ""City of God"". The chicken comes to Rocket with his camera. Then flashbacks to the 60s tell the story of Rocket who becomes the photographer of his friends. Li'l Zé and his best friend Benny grow up to be the crime boss of the city. There's Carrot who is a criminal leader tolerated by Benny and there's Knockout Ned who turned away from crime."
Gangs of Rio,Decko_koji_obecava,17 May 2003,,"If you're unlucky to be born into a socially, economically and racially isolated community that has poverty, crime, drugs and violence as its everyday realities, the odds are stacked incredibly high against you. It literally takes so much effort, strength, struggle and plain ol' good fortune to simply avoid becoming a gangster, let alone do anything more with life. Most who find themselves in the situation described above never even enter this fight and out of those that do - only the rare ones succeed."
"Magnificent, gut-wrenching and utterly compelling",tjcclarke,26 October 2004,10,"Do not be fooled by the coy charm of the promotional poster. The image of the girl shyly leaning over to kiss the cheek of a bare-backed boy on golden sands drenched in sunlight represents an ideal that many residents of the City of God strive for, but few achieve."
Stunning - in every sense of the word,trelloskilos-1,18 December 2004,10,"Cidade de Deus seems to have a lot of praise on the IMDb boards, and with good reason too. It simply is, in my opinion, one of the best contemporary films ever made."
"Shocking, Stylish & Brutal Story",ccthemovieman-1,6 March 2006,8,"Wow, this is one of those different movies - meaning not run-of-mill by any means - and one of those which isn't pleasant to watch but one you might find yourself mesmerized by it."
One of the best unseen foreign films,panjshir_lion,30 March 2005,10,"I have seen this movie only recently (2005) and it's easily one of the better foreign films I have seen. Actually, it's probably just about one of the best films I had ever seen."
Down and dirty,kosmasp,2 April 2007,9,"This movie does not take any prisoners. Although I have not been into any ""favella"" (= ghetto) and I don't really know if the movie depicts it realistically, I do know that it is a gripping story. About kids growing up in a violent environment. Not that this movie is an action movie. It's a drama, with action scenes in it."
Cidade De Deus,ElChivoDave,8 January 2003,10,"The film, directed by Fernando Meirelles, tells the story of life in the slums of Rio de Janeiro, in an area known as the Cidade De Deus, the City of God.  The story is told from the narration of the young photographer, Rocket.  The different scenarios of life that make up the wider-story are presented in Pulp Fiction style chapters, complete with on-screen titles for each different story component.  The story covers all the facets of the life, charting the growth of several key members of the gangs from childhood through to young adulthood, with their transformation from young hoodlums to local drugs barons.  The final parts of the story focus on the battle within the Cidade De Deus between two different groups, when business and personal matters lead to an unavoidable confrontation.  And what a confrontation it is, although details will not be given away here.  The result is a powerful telling of life based around real-life events."
One of my top 10,michaelgs,26 November 2004,,"I have made an effort to watch all the movies in IMDb's top 100 rated list. As of now, I'm looking for a place where the DVD for Sunset Blvd. is (currently at #30). But this movie is one of the movies I've seen that's on the list. And I find it an amazing film (currently #5 on my top 10 list). What I enjoy about this film is the visual look of the film, but also the way the director puts you in the story. At the end of the film you have become friends with just about everyone in the film, even though some of the characters are very despicable people. The violence hits you in the chest like a load of bricks sometimes, especially when you recognize that many of the kids involved in the violence are right around 10 or 11, but you also realize that this reflects the culture of the slum these kids live in."
Raw and cult film,janicenichols-32565,28 September 2018,9,I agree with the other positive reviews here. I just saw this again after 15 years - still far exceeds anything made today when it comes to struggles of troubled youth in urban slums plagued by drugs and violence. So raw. So shocking to the system. Highly recommended!
The Other (Sad) Side of the Wonderful City of Rio de Janeiro,claudio_carvalho,1 November 2003,10,"The story begins in the present days, in a barbecue party in the slum of 'Cidade de Deus', with some bandits chasing a chicken. Then, a teenager called Buscapé (Alexandre Rodrigues) tells the story of the Cidade de Deus and the main characters of the movie (Zé Pequeno, Bené, Cenoura etc.), since they were kids."
Sprawling crime masterwork from Brazil,Leofwine_draca,17 February 2016,10,"Wow, what a great movie! I'd heard plenty about this low budget Brazilian gangster film before I got around to seeing it when it showed on television in the middle of the night, but I was fully prepared to be disappointed. Many times a film has been hyped up so much that it's a let down when I finally see it, but not so this one: CITY OF GOD is a tremendous film, a masterpiece in fact. In many ways it's like a lower budget, more realistic version of the classic gangster films made by the likes of Martin Scorcese and Guy Ritchie and in many places it equals the heights of those two directors at the top of their game."
"""One of the best films you'll ever see!""--Roger Ebert, does it live up to the hype?",ragin_kagin,28 November 2004,10,"The film revolves around the, 'City of God,' a favela (or ghetto) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, a horrifying area where drug dealers run the community, and where children killing children is not an uncommon occurrence."
This is a masterpiece that is definitely worth your time,kevin_robbins,23 August 2021,10,"City of God (2002) is a movie I originally saw at an advance screening in DC and is now in my DVD collection. It is also available on HBOMax. The storyline has a coming of age feel to it and takes place in the slums of Rio. It tells the tale of a young man trying to accomplish his goals as well as the lifestyle of other kids that grew up in his surroundings the same time as he did. This movie is directed by Fernando Meirelles (The Constant Gardner) and stars Alexandre Rodrigues (Paradise City), Leandro Firmino (Trash), Seu Jorge (Life Aquatic) and Alice Braga (I am Legend). Almost every single aspect of this movie is perfect. I loved the settings and backdrops and how they were filmed. It really did a good job of depicting the character's desperate circumstances. The portrayal of the characters and their evolution as they aged was also very well done. The narration throughout the movie helped with several transitions and established an understanding of the main character's mindset. The violence in this is very sudden and heart wrenching. They do such a good job of establishing the characters and making you feel something for what makes them tick which makes the various circumstances even more interesting. Their backstories are so well developed. The soundtrack is also very good. Overall this is a masterpiece that is definitely worth your time and an easy 10/10."
The Best Film Ever Made,moviesleuth2,20 June 2008,10,"Before anyone says anything, hear me out. According to the IMDb Top 250 list, ""The Godfather"" reigns supreme as number one, while ""City of God,"" or more appropriately, ""Cidade de Deus,"" is at the number 17 slot. But to compare the two is like comparing an Arnold Schwartzenegger movie to ""Crash."" They are just too different. But for me, while Francis Ford Coppolla's 1972 film is rightly considered a masterpiece, ""City of God"" is more memorable and packs a bigger punch. That, and ""The Godfather"" has had 30 more years under its belt to gather its legendary status. And it's in English (which, sadly, makes a lot of difference)."
Excellent and violent film based on real events,ma-cortes,18 October 2004,7,"The movie deals about children and adolescent factions in the impoverished Favelas , Rio Janeiro , for 1960 and 1970 years . And it centers upon a teen who tries to leave that world by means of the photography . The final confrontation among the motley gangs for Favelas control is pretty violent and bloody ."
Phenomenal,FilmOtaku,4 October 2004,9,"There are many films that don't live up to the hype they are afforded, particularly modern day films. 'City of God', directed by Fernando Meirelles is not one of them. From the moment the film began until halfway through the closing credits, my eyes did not leave the television once. Based on a true story, 'City of God' spans two decades and is about rival street gangs in the town Cidade de Deus (City of God), just outside of Rio de Janeiro. The city is one where the government sends the 'unwanted' residents of Rio, so most of the inhabitants are homeless, criminal and/or dirt poor. The story is told through the eyes of Rocket, a young boy who manages to stay on the outer fringe of the gangs, befriending some of the hoods, but not participating. What he discovers he wants to do is become a photojournalist, and begins to take photographs of his neighborhood. When he is in his late teens/early twenties, he goes to work delivering newspapers, when one of his photographs of the slum gang boss is discovered and published without his permission, putting his life in danger, but beginning his professional career."
An unsparing portrait of a sociopathic generation,howard.schumann,17 February 2003,,"""After the first death, there is no other"" - Dylan Thomas"
Easily my favourite movie of all time!,chengjeffrey99,30 October 2018,10,"Incredible film. Not much to say, yet I could say it all. The film is absolutely splendid in its use of colour, characters and especially music. Though some might complain of the shaky Super 16 footage, it is evidently for effect as the first half (golden age) is filmed with lots of aerials, and smooth, precise shots."
Almost Too Much to Watch,Hitchcoc,24 November 2009,9,"One must step back from an absolute sense of repugnance at the violence and look at what the filmmaker has done in this movie. Once you tune yourself into the lives of this cast of characters and their ongoing effort to stay alive and maintain dominance, you can reflect on the amazing cinematography and overall effect of the film. There is an ebb and floe that we watch, almost a dance in the slums of Rio. There is so much poverty that factions have grown up and the people are continually victimized by them as are there individual members. The police are perpetually on the take, so a military state is eventually set up. The main character is a participant early on and then an observer. His photographic skills are his ticket out and his ticket in. There is death and destruction, drugs and murder around every corner. Perhaps the scariest thing are a group of young boys called the Runts who are making a seamless transition into the horrors of the place, keeping things going for yet another generation. I think the most dominant theme of the whole thing has to do with the indifference toward death. Even those who are friends early on will kill their friends because a drug lord says so. It's an unforgettable film."
The best film to ever come out of Latin America,denkixd51,20 October 2019,10,"This is just a masterpiece of story-telling, a movie made with love and passion from everyone involved, simply an amazing movie, go watch it, I just can tell you this: City of God is the best film of Latin America, possibly the best film of the decade, and definitely one of the best films ever made."
"In terms of movie-making, there's nothing like it.",secondtake,14 July 2010,9,City of God (2002)
City of God was Incredible,sarahdelore,7 June 2003,10,"I knew nothing of this film before I saw it by chance in a rare Pub open screening, but boy was I glad I got the chance to take a look. I was riveted all night - I completely ignored my friends! I thought it was an awesome re-enactment of a true story - powerful, moving, raw, real - and even funny in parts. I walked away afterwards, beaming. It's rare a great film like this is made, especially these days. I gave it ten out of ten. Please see it if you can."
A Cinematic Achievement,dashtag1234,23 December 2020,9,"Fernando Mierelles is a genius. I'll tell you why. He directed a bunch of non-actors and made them feel real, like they were real characters. It's not like these guys are playing themselves 100% I'm sure the actor of Lil Ze is not a real psychopath. The way City of God is shot makes it feel real, like a documentary, and it is kind of beautiful. The storytelling is clever, and the use of shots is also very clever. Can't believe how this movie didn't win or get nominated for best foreign. It's violent and brutal, but still a remarkable film."
The gangs of Rio,jotix100,7 February 2003,8,"Quentin Tarantino, eat your heart out! At least in this film they outshot you big time. Watching this film is difficult at times. The violence is to such a degree, the viewer has a problem seating through it."
Authentic and indelible,DennisLittrell,29 December 2005,9,"(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)"
a horrible movie that I strongly recommend,planktonrules,13 November 2005,9,"When I say ""horrible"" I am referring to the vileness of the characters and terrible images in the film. Technically speaking, this is a great film--with some of the most amazing and innovative cinematography I have ever seen. The stories are interwoven very well and the film seems so very real. It is so unfortunate at the film's conclusion you find out that although these are actors, the story itself is true. It's just so hard to imagine living in this hell on Earth in Rio. After seeing this film, there's no way I am ever visiting Brazil!! I'm sure many viewers feel the same way due to the absolute brutality of their slums where the police do little to interfere with gangs who run it."
The Three-Body Problem,tedg,9 March 2003,,Spoilers herein.
Visceral and Fabulous,evanston_dad,29 April 2005,10,"""City of God"" is an adrenaline jolt of a film that for once manages to find a balance between stylistics and substance. The director, Fernando Meirelles, stuffs his movie to the brim with machine-gun editing, swirling cinematography and pounding music, but while this reliance on fancy tricks has ruined other films, Meirelles is so expert at blending them seamlessly into an engrossing story that the viewer quickly accepts them as inseparable from the world of the film. He delivers a deeply emotional and human story that obviously owes much to Scorsese and Tarantino---but his movie feels completely original, never like a rip off. And underneath all of the action and plotting, there is a compelling message about about the power of art (specifically the camera) and a suggestion that, just as the pen is mightier than the sword, the camera is mightier than the gun. Can't recommend it enough."
The Hype and Acclaim is Real: Cidade de Deus delivers.,TheWillVega,31 August 2006,9,Long before have I seen movies being overly praised but were not worth the hype and time and vice versa for the rest. It's been like that for a few years already.
an exillerating ride through the life of gangsters,jpisani-1,15 December 2004,10,"I am a big fan of foreign film, because its great to see directors with different points of view than the average American director. City of God is the epitome of a great foreign film. It shows the classic struggle between right and wrong, in a brand new way. The raw directing style, coupled with a great soundtrack makes for a movie which many different kinds of people can enjoy. Weather your a Harvard intellectual or the local idiot, you can enjoy this. The vicious cycle of the gangster lifestyle is portrayed with haunting accuracy. It even forces the audience to sympathize with some of the nastiest thugs in the world. All in all, City of God is one the greatest movies of my time and each time i watch it i enjoy it more than the last."
From the first moment to the last this movie is enthralling!,mungo39,31 May 2005,10,"The first moment of the film shows us a swaggering gangster preparing food somewhere in the Favella of Rio de Janeiro. A knife scrapes across a whetstone, a chicken is plucked, fabulously atmospheric music plays in the background and a second chicken makes a break for his life! A chase ensues, the poor chicken being pursued by a whole gang of hoods, armed to the teeth, and the frenzy stops with our hero (Rocket) being caught between heavily armed Policemen, the chicken and the hoods. Violence seems inevitable, and things look bad for Rocket..."
Explores a world or violence and moral ambiguity rarely depicted on film,Chris_Docker,30 January 2003,8,"The most moving moment in a trip I made to Brasil occurred when I visited a community school in the slums (favelas). These children were desperately trying to better themselves  the school (paid for from community and rotararian funds with no government help) was their *only* chance to get out of the cycle of hopelessness and crime. The awful dilemma was that the community and its inhabitants were protected and supported (with no strings attached) by the local drugs and gun running infrastructure. I was safer there than on the streets of Copacabana  no-one would harm a tourist as that might attract police attention (bad for business). One infraction to law and order would mean a warning  the second, death."
I was pretty invested!,SPZMaxinema,5 April 2022,8,"The characterization and drama in this movie was done quite well. While I didn't like some of the directing techniques with the camera-work in some moments, in other moments it was directed quite well! I liked the ending a lot with Lil Z's demise and the twists that took place, plus how the cycle of a life of crime that infested the streets got passed down to yet another generation, quite a powerful movie! I would've never thought that I'd like a film quite like this!"
Just... fantastic.,Flagrant-Baronessa,22 June 2006,10,"City of God is set in poverty-stricken and corrupt Rio de Janeiro and bravely zooms in on its young citizens in their extremely violent day-to-day circumstances. Some of them are really only just kids. I don't mean kids like ""rowdy teens"", but actual little children with guns and blood on their hands. It is quite heartbreaking to watch, but very compelling at the same time."
Must Watch!,mikayakatnt,16 October 2019,10,"Hands down one of the best crime films out there. I enjoyed the story-telling, grittiness, and abject realism of this film. There were moments where I forgot that I was watching a work of fiction."
A Latin Masterpiece That Is As Hard To Watch As It Is Hard To Look Away From!,AhmedSpielberg99,19 September 2018,9,"Superb editing, and Fernando Meirelles splashy direction made this movie visually stunning, and this was necessary. Because without being so, City of God wouldn't have been the easiest hard-to-watch movie to be watched! I know that sounds weird, but I'm not kidding this movie is so disturbing and shocking, but its vibrant visual style made it impossible to look away from."
A masterpiece,mahmus,15 May 2020,10,"It gets very hard to watch, but I can't take my eyes away from the screen."
A really slick and impressive gangster movie,bob the moo,25 December 2003,,"In the slums of Rio de Janeiro is an area called the city of God.  In this area children often do not make it to adulthood.  Rocket is a young man looking to use photography to get himself out of the slums and away from crime.  We follow his story from a child through the 60's and 70's in the slums where he is witness as children Lil' Dice and Bene grow up to become the heads of the gangs, using violence and murder to increase their power."
"""City Of God"" (Cidade de Deus) is the best Brazilian film of all time.",fabioslimma,21 November 2020,10,"""City Of God"" (Cidade de Deus) is the best Brazilian film of all time. Technically perfect in directing, cinematography, editing, soundtrack and cast. Realistic, violent, impactful, this film is cinema of the best quality"
As real as it gets,Otoboke,29 September 2007,,"City of God is a fantastically made film filled with memorable characters all mixed into a story that will hold your attention from beginning to end. There's seriously not much wrong with this movie at all and has some of the best performances I've seen to date in modern cinema. Fernando Meirelles certainly makes his mark here, creating a realistically brutal rendition of a true story based around a violent neighbourhood of Rio de Janeiro in the 60's and 70's."
"Good, but underwhelming",Jared_Andrews,1 August 2014,7,"The opening scene set the tone for what was to come in the next two hours. What should have been a jolting and gripping experience, ended up underwhelming. The events should have made for a dramatic and even suspenseful sequence, but the ancillary movie elements added little to the scene."
Of how a chicken escaped alive,pedrofjmk,10 March 2005,10,"Let's imagine for a split-second that you have not read a line about 'City of God' as you click Play in your remote. As the footage starts, the camera snaps back and forth in a frenzy, people dance the samba, a party is on the make, a poor chicken watches as her mates become chicken wings. And hence we get to the big chicken run. It's the most brilliant scene of the whole movie - in fact, the whole movie revolves around it. Around this frantic scene and the shooting that follows and that sadly shows the reality of thousands of Brazilians in Rio and elsewhere. There is no space in Paulo Lins' novel for the idle hedonism of 'Capitães da Areia', the renown Jorge Amado classic that tells us the story of a junior delinquent gang in the streets of Salvador in Bahia. 'City of God' simply has no space. Not even space for the viewer. From the first scene onwards, you are permanently reminded that you aren't but a viewer, that you are outside, that you have absolutely not the slightest-faintest-slimmest idea of what it feels like to be inside. The narrative structure is a strike of genius in that sense. Not that it was a cutting-edge idea - it has been done time and time again. But the manipulation of at least three hand-held cameras, the constant sound of samba and the relapses of the story, together with the sheer vivacity of the original dialogues (mind you, I do mean the original, extremely nuanced Rio favela-slang Portuguese dialogues!!) make the movie possible to be watched without post-traumatic-stress. You are outside, and you know it. Your whole body is either stiff or numb, uncomfortable in any case. That strange butterfly-cold-revolving sensation in your stomach reminds you that you are not comfortable. The way you breathe (or don't)reminds you that you're not comfortable. The way you bite your knuckles or shake your head in disbelief, perhaps the dampness of your eyes when that young child cries in fear of being shot dead reminds you that you are not comfortable, that this is not your world. Sometimes, in your deep discomfort, your thoughts will go ashtray, only to be rescued back by the next still, the next title, the nest flashback that requires your attention. That is the stylistic exercise that achieves the objective of keeping you focused and in your seat. That is the role Meirelles responsibly takes as film director."
A Heavy Cloud Over Heaven.,tfrizzell,17 September 2004,,"A popular surge swept the land just prior to the 2003 Oscars and ""City of God"" became a critical success with the Academy. The popularity is somewhat misleading though as this production has tons of problems with its Oscar-nominated script and uneven performances across the board. The setting early is 1960s Rio de Janeiro. A ghetto just outside the city limits is the breeding ground for dangerous gangs of thugs who are little more than adolescents who go around and create chaotic violence. One of these youngsters grows to become Leandro Firmino, a heartless miscreant who toes the line between just being cruel and being down-right psychotic. He is kept somewhat under control by his top assistant Phellipe Haagensen, but in their world both are in as much danger as those that come into contact with them. As all this goes on another youngster (who grows to become Alexandre Rodrigues) from the same neighborhood looks to take a different route completely by trying to become a photographer. Rodrigues, like his contemporaries, also has a life that seems to be on a tight time table. The picture advances to the 1980s and the ultimate fates of the primary characters come shining through in vivid and ironic fashions. Directors Fernando Meirelles (Oscar-nominated in the category) and Katia Lund develop a technologically interesting picture that benefits greatly from landmark cinematography by Oscar-nominee Cesar Charlone and highly difficult editing techniques by Daniel Rezende (also Oscar-nominated). The camera-work is enough to give this film a high mark, but once again the performers are not as good as advertised and the script by Oscar-nominee Braulio Mantovani is unsteady and a bit pretentious. The fact that the tale is based on fact does not really give the picture any more credibility than it would have if it had been from the mind of a foreign screenwriter. The characters are not always believable and are usually not worth caring about. Many problems, but still a noble and overall intriguing product. 4 stars out of 5."
Tall and Tan and Young and Packing,siriver,26 April 2004,,"'What are you doing, you're just a kid?' ""I steal, I kill, I carry a gun, how can I be just a kid? I am a man."""
"The Brazilian ""Goodfellas"" ...",ElMaruecan82,20 February 2014,10,"The opening of ""City of God"" is inhabited by a voodoo-like trance, as if the whole spirit of Rio de Janeiro's titular suburbs was translating its turbulent and tortured soul into one of the most thrilling pieces of editing you'll ever see in a film."
"Life & Death on the mean streets in ""The City of God""",sol1218,21 June 2004,9,"****SPOILERS**** The movie ""The City of God"" starts where it ends with a bloody showdown between the Li'lZe mob and their very young allies ""The Young Runts"" having it out with the Carrot and Ned Knockout gang. Sandwiched between those two scenes are a number of brutal killings that dull your senses and condition you for the movies ferocious and climactic bloodbath. Savage and surrealistic movie about life and death in the slums of Rio de Janeiro and how great the odds are for anybody surviving in that ""Hell on Earth""."
Been rewatching it for decades,JoseyWales0,16 April 2021,10,And for decades to come.
A city of God where God is non-existent!,elsinefilo,2 January 2006,,"""City of God"" is about making your own way really! No matter in which conditions you're living in the life you lead is not always conglomeration of what you've lived always but it's something you pick and choose in a life you lead. The more you have power to direct yourself, to choose for yourself, the more decisive and decided you are the more successful you will be. Of course the society always shapes people and it's not the linchpin for your destiny. The movie is such a story. While Rocket dreams of being a photographer and makes his way into that dream Lil Ze is a hoodlum who satisfies his thirst for murder, who plunders and who desire more and more power. City of God is totally realistic! I am impressed by the fact that most of the actors in the film had never acted before and were, in fact, residents of favelas(slums)such as Vidigal and the ""City of God"" itself. The setting and the time fiction seems totally realistic too.If you wanna a realist piece of story do not forgo watching until the end!"
A Mindblowing Masterpiece!,phoenix-ks,4 May 2005,10,This movie is absolutely amazing! It is a cinematic tour de force. It is undoubtedly one of the top ten best movies ever made. Comparable to American masterpieces such as Goodfellas or Pulp Fiction. But it is its own unique film.
Unmoved (some small spoilers),MobileMotion,7 June 2005,7,"This film has been executed with considerable skill - 10/10 for visual and storytelling style. It is brilliant, expert and flawless in its execution."
Among the 24 best movies ever? Come on!,jgcorrea,18 September 2013,4,"Many consider a movie outstanding just because it shows tragic poverty and violence. Subconsciously, I mean CONSCIOUSLY. People feel ""politically correct"" for liking it. Praise becomes a form of self-elevation."
Watched it a while ago but it's still a reference to this day,Ashitaka137,14 April 2021,10,"The storytelling, the screenwriting, the directing, etc... practically everything in this movie is perfection! Definitely a must watch."
Great film that deserved to be recognized,Agent10,14 August 2006,9,"One thing is for certain, City of God didn't back down on the shock value. From the random killing of children to the more organized gang violence, City of God is more of a testament to the failures of capitalism rather than a failure of law and order. Either way, the film was a stunning depiction of a world no one really gets to see. This is a world you don't see in the tourist guides or in the movies."
"Excellent, but overrated by the IMDb-users",Travis_Bickle01,30 October 2005,8,"""Cidade de Deus"" is the breakthrough of Brazilian director Fernando Meirelles (""The Constant Gardener""). It tells the unbelievable but true story of the gang life in a poor neighbourhood of Rio de Janeiro. The neighbourhood is mostly ruled by kids and young adults, who doesn't play cowboy and Indian like most kids of their age do. No, most of the time they are busy dealing drugs, robbing local stores or killing other young adults in order to extend their territory."
Somewhat Flawed Film,ThomasColquith,1 June 2021,5,"I recently re-watched ""City of God"" for the first time in 15 years, and it was worse than I remembered. I had held this film in high esteem, but now, perhaps being older, I see more issues. First the positives: this film treads ground rarely done -- exploring the Brazilian favelas and the social issues endemic there. I think it is good to raise awareness about the plight of the less fortunate -- those whom by birth have less resources and opportunities afforded to them. However, there is a fine line to walk between raising awareness and just glorifying violence. I'm not saying that was the intent, but when all you see for two hours is violence, it is hard to think beyond that."
Brilliant but tough to watch,gelman@attglobal.net,22 December 2005,9,"There are exactly two characters in this movie -- Rocket and Knockout Ned -- who are in any way sympathetic. Everyone else is a villain or victim, usually both. The film does not contain a single frame that relieves the brutality, violence, poverty and degradation which are its themes. See it but understand what you'll be seeing: drug trafficking and casual murder (mostly done for ""business"" reasons but also for the sheer pleasure of killing) by young people and even by children in a terrible, terror-ridden Rio de Janeiro slum. In its way it is harder to watch even than Hotel Rwanda because of its apparent ""artlessness."" You have more of a feeling in City of God that you are actually there, witnessing unbelievably awful events without the small distance that Hotel Rwanda afforded because it was scripted and acted and ""directed,"" because it was art. This movie, on the other hand, feels like you are watching it happen in front of your eyes without a scriptwriter's story telling or a director's mediation. Those illusions are helped along by the fact that there's not a single actor that I recognized from any other movie. The actors ARE the drug dealers, the killers and the victims -- not, as in ""Traffic,"" well-known actors ""playing"" at being drug dealers, killers and victims. ""Traffic"" was very well done. This movie is harrowing."
Kids in the Hood,Jexxon,20 January 2005,4,To sum it up in one word: overrated.
"If you haven't seen it, you really should!",themovieguy-02393,16 October 2020,10,"This is one of my favorite films of all time and it is incredible how well it stands up over time. For me this is an absolute classic and one of the films that helped kick off a life long love of cinema. If you haven't seen it, you honestly owe yourself the favor."
Good,thorodinson-50130,15 May 2021,,"9.1
One of the best non English movie. Brazilian mafia."
City of God,baumhenrik,23 June 2019,9,"As one of the highest rated movies on IMDb, I had a certain expectation when watching it and it's easy to say that the movie kept up with it."
Disappointing,=G=,10 June 2004,5,"""City of God"" is an old story. So old, in fact, it begins in the 60's as it tells of gangsters in a Rio de Janeiro slum who do what gangsters do and have done everywhere for all the same reasons. Poverty breeds ignorance which breeds hopelessness which breeds desperation which breeds crime...etc. This film shows us nothing new, save the location and its paper thin characters, as it takes the audience into a slew of favela-dwelling punks with guns (so many it's hard to keep track of who's who and who killed who for what reason) as it attempts to impart a sense of warring in the Rio ghetto. You'll see such a convoluted mess of gang bangers there's no time for the film to provide character depth or a sense of the gangster ethos or the mechanics of the drug trade or a reason to care who lives or dies, etc. Just a whole lot of killing with numbing excess and only a hint of a human story. For reasons I am unable to deduce, ""City of God"" received raves from all corners and countless awards and noms. Go freakin' figure! Personally, I found the documentary piggy-backed into the DVD more interesting than the film and the one scene from the film I remember most (it was shown twice) was that of a chicken which was run over by a truck but escaped unscathed. If you like your street punk killing flicks with subtitles, go for it. (C+)"
Not nearly as good as advertised...,buiger,28 May 2017,7,"I saw this movie with a couple of friends, and none of us had any prior knowledge of the film. Interestingly enough, none of us where overly impressed... I only realized afterwards, when I went on to IMDb to write my review, that this is considered by many to be one of the best motion pictures ever made! I was shocked. Not to say that it is a bad movie, because it isn't, but it is nowhere near being very good, let alone a masterpiece."
Very Disappointed,bilahn,1 April 2006,5,"Based on the near universal praise from critics and viewers alike and my interest in Brazilian culture, not to mention the buzz about the cinematography, I was eager to see this film, despite my lack of interest in violence as entertainment."
"One of the rawest, most realistic films that I have ever seen",ridgyolive,26 June 2020,10,"I just saw this movie, and it is one of the best foreign language films that I think I have ever seen! I have recently been getting into foreign cinema with a lot of the Korean movies (Parasite, Oldboy), and I know there is no comparing them, since they are completely different, this movie holds up with them! It might even be better! It is fantastic, it utilizes the gritty cinematography and the editing to play to the themes of the story very much. It may be one of the best looking and flowing films that I have ever seen. It is really something unique, and I would recommend anyone to watch this."
Scaring and amazingly good,udeaasykle,7 March 2004,10,"This was a delight to be watching. When i say delight i don't mean i like seeing people get killed over nothing but it was so masterfully done. I have heard only good things about this movie so i was prepared for a excellent movie, and let me tell you i was not disappointed at all. The movie shows how little a human life is worth in some people eyes. The scariest part is to see the young kids, probably not more than 7-10 years old, carrying guns, thinking it is cool to kill others. The thing i remember best is when one of the young kids says: I smoke and snort. I have robbed and killed. I am a man! What kind of life do you live when you can say that sentence and believe it? Anyways, this is a very good movie and i give it the best rating i can. 10"
"a powerhouse crime saga, with a fierce, daunting fusion of style",Quinoa1984,8 August 2003,10,"City of God played for months on end at an the Angelika theater in New York City back in 2003, and I was hesitant whether or not I should go there to spend ten dollars and to sit in a little theater with a packed audience, or to wait in video. I gave in to my temptations to see the film, from what I heard from various reviewers, and by the end, I knew it was truly worth the admission, and then some. Director Fernando Meirelles, along with co-director Katia Lund, crafts a film that steams so much with a passion to tell this story, to reveal all these characters (most of which who wear their flaws right on their sleeves like badges of honor), and to be honest with how their tales unfold, that even the most die-hard of action film or gangster connoisseur will feel the visceral, hardcore nature of the City of God long after the lights come up, subtitles and all."
Best Movie Oscar?,lucas-benvenuti,26 April 2021,10,How can this Movie not even been incated as Best Movie ir at least best foreing Movie?
A must see masterpiece.,colinjbooth,12 May 2020,10,"If Martin Scorcese and Quentin Tarantino had a Brazilian baby, this would be that baby. An incredible, powerful, stylish, authentic tour-de-force or filmmaking made all the more incredible by the budget and the perfect child actors. Of the top IMDb movies, this may be the least we'll known, possibly because it is 'foreign' or just because it doesn't have a name actor or big studio behind it, but make no mistake it earns its place in the upper echelons of all-time classics."
Kids With Guns,flickershows,1 March 2004,8,"'City Of God' is not an easy film to watch, nor is it an easy film to like. Were it not for the stark reality that permeates most of the production, this could have been a modern zombie flick. None of the characters in this movie are really alive anyway. They're the walking dead, living each moment with the threat of death knocking holes in their front door. The actors do the best they can with powerful material that offers them no real hope. As I said, zombie flick."
"A thoroughly absorbing, powerful and unforgettable movie experience",wellthatswhatithinkanyway,8 May 2006,10,STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits
It leaves the judgments to the viewer,brower8,25 January 2005,10,"With a Dickensian plot (if the content is un-bowdlerized), a child nicknamed ""Rocket"" (as translated in the English subtitles) relates his rise from a ghetto-dweller to a successful photojournalist who exposes the harsh world of his origin to the complacent Brazilians who live in the picture-postcard world of its upper and middle classes, and his entry into their world. ""Rocket"" is effectively the narrator."
"If it's not from Hollywood, it must be good",Elori,29 September 2007,3,"There are certain people who have developed a very negative view towards Hollywood movies and U.S. cinema. In this mindset, any movie coming from the US is automatically lambasted, while non-US cinema is praised without merit. City of God, or Cidade de Deus, is one such case. Its serious overvaluing can only be attributed to a cloudy-eyed sentimentalism for the real situation behind the movie without even considering whether the movie itself has value in portraying that situation. And the unfortunate case is, no. Meirelles and Luns' generic directing is completely devoid of feeling and insight, and the actors are merely going through the motions, lacking any emotional impact in the actual proceeding of the screenplay. For these failings, the film collapses into a jiltingly generic mashup of violence and crime, with nothing to tell. There is no shock value, there is no empathy, there are no thoughts evoked. Perhaps this movie has some appeal and bearing to people who are more closely connected to Brazil and the kind of events portrayed, seeing as they can draw from another experience to put some weight into the matter, for this film by itself has none. It takes a special kind of pretentiousness and self-delusion to rate this film highly on its own merits, and the kind of a critic that dares not criticize a film with a sensitive subject. Yet this film desperately needs more of a voice of reason to call it for the empty shell it is."
What can make human beings inhuman to this extent?,shi612,10 August 2006,10,"This is a literally terrific movie. I was drawn as soon as the opening scene started. The barbecue party on the roof in a crowded houses. The scene they edge a knife and open the chickens with sense of exhilaration gives you feeling of a mixed atmosphere of festivity and cruelty of the whole movie. Then a chicken runs away, and the scene the lead character is flanked by a group of gang and the police immediately turns to another scene of 20 years ago. A breathtaking opening."
City of Brilliance,kenjha,18 May 2007,9,"This saga about kids growing up in a violent and drug-infested neighborhood of Rio de Janeiro is fresh and vibrant from its droll opening scene to its riveting finale. It is brilliantly directed by Meirelles, who fuses an innovative story-telling technique with a fine script and terrific camera-work to create a memorable cinematic experience. The tension is palpable throughout, specially in a heart-wrenching scene where one child is prodded to shoot another as a gang initiation ritual. Although the subject matter is violence, the film never dwells on it, focusing instead on characters and circumstances. There is fine ensemble acting from a cast of non-stars."
"It doesn't suffice to call ""City of God"" a Brazilian ""Mean Streets"".",lee_eisenberg,17 October 2005,10,"""Cidade de Deus"" (called ""City of God"" in English) knocks the breath out of you. This story of life in Brazilian slums makes you feel like you're in the slums with the characters. It follows Rocket (Alexandre Rodrigues) as he grows up in these places, and then joins a gang. You see, in these slums, either you join a gang or nothing ever becomes of you. So, Rocket is pulled through a world of drugs, violence, and every ugly thing that you can imagine; it's his only ticket out of complete isolation."
An insight into a Horrifying wonderland...,Moviespot,30 June 2007,10,"Especially everybody in my part of the world /the 'rich' countries , should see this film. The incredible hardness of day to day existence is breathtaking... Live in the Favella's is like living in hell... a place where one can be shot by 11 year old kids at random.... There is nowhere where a threatened person can turn to.... they cannot go to the police because they are a big part of the problem.they too cash on in on the earnings of the favella gangs . Corruption violence death , drugs & destruction...the reality in Brazil's Favella's , Ghetto's.. A life of no hope , no love and no Humanity...its heartbreaking !"
Shocking,icc-12655,29 May 2020,9,"I am a big fan of foreign film, because its great to see directors with different points of view than the average American director. City of God is the epitome of a great foreign film. It shows the classic struggle between right and wrong, in a brand new way. The raw directing style, coupled with a great soundtrack makes for a movie which many different kinds of people can enjoy. Weather your a Harvard intellectual or the local idiot, you can enjoy this. The vicious cycle of the gangster lifestyle is portrayed with haunting accuracy. It even forces the audience to sympathize with some of the nastiest thugs in the world. All in all, City of God is one the greatest movies of my time and each time i watch it i enjoy it more than the last."
"""What should have been swift revenge turned into an all out war. The City of God was divided.""",ackstasis,9 February 2007,8,"Planned and executed by the state government of Guanabara, the quarter of Cicade de Deus (City of God) was built in 1960 as part of a policy to remove all favelas (shanty towns; slums) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. ""We came to the City of God hoping to find paradise,"" reminisces Rocket, our narrator. ""Many families were homeless due to flooding and acts of arson in the slums the big wigs in government didn't joke around. Homeless? Off to City of God!"" Nowadays, Cicade de Deus is infamous as a high crime quarter, rife with social problems. ""There was no electricity, paved streets or transportation. But for the powerful, our problems didn't matter. We were far too removed from the picture postcard image of Rio de Janeiro."" Fernando Meirelles and Kátia Lund's acclaimed Brazilian film ""City of God"" dares to veer from this ""postcard image"" of Brazilian life, creating an intense and uncompromising glimpse at life in the violent and drug-infested slums at the heart of the city."
Too slick for its own good,Maciste_Brother,25 January 2005,1,"Though a lot of people and critics have praised this Brazilian movie, I have to say that I did not like it at all. The story is bleak & serious and yet it's filmed like a GAP commercial, with a lot of stylish editing, camera movements (like the annoying 360 degrees one) and direction, which totally belies the story's tragic intent."
Not everyone's gonna watch it to the end,zozulyamak,27 January 2021,7,"""City of God"" is a cruel, unfair, forsaken place, you'll find nothing holly there. It's a really far, obscure and tough world that is hard for me to comprehend. The characters are immoral and wicked."
Mesmerizing and Sad,view_and_review,31 December 2021,8,"A few years ago I read a book titled ""Never Stop Walking"" by Christina Rickardsson. It was an autobiography about her life in the favelas of Brazil before being adopted by a Swedish family and moving to Sweden. I remember being shocked to read that children killed and were killed regularly in the favelas. And even with that knowledge that still didn't quite prepare me for ""City of God."""
"Brazilian ""Goodfellas""; The kids are not alright ; excellent!",george.schmidt,5 March 2003,,"CITY OF GOD (2002) ****  Matheus Nachtergaele, Seu Jorge, Alexandre Rodrigues, Leanro Firmino da Hora, Philippe Haagensen, Johnathan Haagensen, Douglas Silva, Roberta Rodriguez Silvia, Alice Braga .  Absorbing and compelling tale of young Brazilian boys who grow into gangsters/drug dealers and other dregs of society in the ghettos of Rio de Janeiro circa the late 1960s/1970s era that focuses on one attempting to leave his dead end environs by  becoming a photojournalist and for pure survival at all costs. Astonishing in its matter-of-fact violent bluntness that sends a shock to the senses to see pre-adolescents brandishing all sorts of weapons and killing for the fun of it; rampant anarchy peppered with moments of innocence.  Filmmakers Katia Lund and Fernando Meirelles  transcend the feel of a docudrama's trappings in their adaptation of Paulo Lin's true-life account of the mean streets of Brazil with a decidedly improvisatory screenplay adaptation by Braulio Mantovani.  Kudos to the inventive cinematography by Cesar Charlone and  energetic editing by Daniel Rezende that owe much to Scorsese, Tarantino, and PT Anderson for its storytelling through flashback cuts , title cards, character intros,  and overall mise en scene yet has a unique, original feel altogether as well.  A truly excellent piece of dramatic filmmaking."
Behind the doors of hell,paul2001sw-1,3 January 2007,9,"Fernando Meirelles portrait of gang life, 'City of God', has been likened to Martin Scorcese's 'Goodfellas', but it's far more visceral, and less stylised, than that film, and underpinned by a portrait of the appalling poverty of the Brazillian slums. Fast-paced, superbly acted, uncompromising and without a whiff of glamour, it's a movie that re-invents the tired old gangster genre by actually telling it as it is, and not as the clichés tell us to expect, and a serious piece of social and political history on the side. This is a very fine film, one in which shreds of tattered humanity gleam through the cracks of the doors of hell."
Wow,jack_o_hasanov_imdb,27 August 2021,9,"Watching the movie was difficult. Rio is indeed a dangerous city. I've seen the name of this movie a lot in the ""best movies"" lists. In fact, I recommend this movie. Watch."
Cidade De Deus is Hell On Earth,im_veritas_photo,25 March 2007,5,"First, let me say that this film is extremely difficult to rate (for me, at least). I have been known, on many occasions, to purposely and graciously ignore a film's shortcomings in favor, say, of cinematic excellence. If I could just bring myself to do that for ""Cidade De Deus,"" it would probably rate tops from me."
There are few words to describe this movie,Hawkeleven,12 October 2019,9,"Raw, sincere, carefree, without false pretense, order in the midst of chaos, a movie we should all see at least once in a lifetime."
Godless City!,adamjohns-42575,5 February 2023,5,City Of God (Cidade de Deus) (2002) -
One of the most brilliant and disturbing films I 've ever seen,alfiefamily,24 January 2005,10,"""Cidade de Deus"" (City of God)is the story of how children who ""live"" in one of the forgotten towns near Rio, have no other choice but to resort to drugs, guns and the realization that they can not expect to even hope for a real life."
City of God is the brutal realisation of Rio's uncontrollable gang crime.,TheMovieDiorama,28 February 2018,9,"Set in the infamous slum known simply as ""City of God"", a young man's ambition to become a photographer leads him to the dangerous world of urban warfare. There is so much to take in that one viewing just wouldn't create a clear reflection of the film. It plays out like a typical gangster narrative, two opposing rivalries attempt to own businesses and so bullets rain down upon the streets of Rio. What differentiates this from, let's say Goodfellas, is the sheer brutality and realistic imagery that is conveyed. Murder, rape, drugs...it's all here. But the residents raised in the City of God know no different, it's their way of life. A turf war might happen to one generation, only for the next generation to look up to them and aspire the same desire for power and authority. And so the cycle repeats. It's uncontrollable. The theme of vengeance is prominent as well. How being consumed by revenge can not just lose yourself, but the innocent lives around you. Those who segregate themselves from the violence of gang culture. It's a bold statement but an important one to tell. The favelas and slums of Rio and how the government manage the overgrowing population is what contributes to this lifestyle these people are forced into. Jobs are scarce, the standard of living is low...what else can they resort to? It's a harsh reality, but a reality nonetheless. Plenty of memorable characters, especially their nicknames, that make them human. The natural performances and raw emotion that is portrayed clearly indicates to us that there is a sense of innocence to these gang members. With many of them wanting to remove themselves from the gang culture. Meirelles' direction was frantic and fast paced with a hint of grittiness. That's my only criticism, it's too rapid. Need time to let the raw emotional impact simmer and affect you. I adored the narrative though, embedding character origins within the main plot was refreshing. City of God is one of those rare films that depicts the harsh reality of gang culture."
Astonished to see the highest level of performance,Ray H.,26 July 2009,10,"Gee! A great masterpiece! As soon as the film started, I instantly thought it was a violence film I am not very fond of, but soon I was fastened on the screen. I viewed the film twice in a row."
Masterpiece,cvetanstoyanov,23 February 2023,10,"I saw this movie in december of 2020 and I can still remember all of the scenes. Never have I saw such a good movie. The acting,cinematography,music,setting is just phenomenal. The story goes as smooth as butter. I amazed by it all. This is my favorite movie of all time. It doesn't bore you and keeps you watching. The scene at the dancehall was truly amazing with its lightning. The beaches shown were amazing. The time period of the plot was really well integrated. The way of life in the favela was perfectly shown. Thank you Fernando Meirelles,Kátia Lund and all of the cast for making this masterpiece."
More Movies Should Be Like This One,jzappa,18 October 2006,10,"City of God was made to be remembered, it was made to rivet its audience with every frame, it was made to evoke all emotions, and it was made to be an epic. It succeeds in all of these areas, because it avoids any point where there could be a dull moment. Most films allow gaps in pace with the confidence that they can be made up for with other fantastic points. City of God has you so wound up in it that it leaves you wanting more."
A real shot to the heart,dfranzen70,1 July 2016,9,"City of God (2002, ***1/2) is a brutal look at the drug wars fought in Rio de Janeiro's slums over a period of several decades. It's not always an easy film to watch, but it's utterly gripping and (improbably) humorous at turns."
Ultimately Pointless Drivel,mcjensen-05924,29 August 2021,2,"Well you're in for a 2 hour shootout here. It's not entertaining in any way. From the history of the characters growing up to how they ultimately met their decline, it was just redundant and amateur film making. The dialogue must surely have been written by 10 year olds trying out their first swear words, and man oh man do they continually repeat them. It's threats then violence then threats then killing, and people falling dead when they're hit by gunfire in laughably absurd and unrealistic ways. Extremely childish. Childish writing and directing, and all the so-called adults in this mess act childish too. It ultimately just became rather humorous it was so bad, and faded into the background as I started getting distracted by other things. It's a case of a point being hammered home so many times it loses it's power and eventually all anthenticity. It could have been a gritty portrayal of that part of the world and that type of life, but ended up failing in every aspect for me. Very poor choice of soundtrack also detracted from any possible enjoyment. I've seen exemplary films from Brazil. Funny how they never reached the level of acclaim this film did. Sadly the real talent in this business never floats to the top because what's wanted is overdone nonsense like this. I gave it a star because the squalor of the city is showed realistically, but that was purely by accident."
City of God,jboothmillard,23 April 2007,8,"I first heard of this on a countdown show, then we watched most of it in Film Studies as part of some coursework, and ultimately I found it listed in the book 100 Movies You Must See Before You Die, so I was glad to watch the whole thing, from Oscar nominated director Fernando Meirelles (The Constant Gardener). Basically the story takes place in a slum of Rio De Janeiro, Brazil, and we see the lives of two boys as they grow up in two decades and choose two different paths in life. Zé Pequeno - 'Li'l Zé', formally knows as Dadinho - 'Li'l Dice' (Douglas Silva) as a child, grew up surrounded by and embracing crime and violence. His best friend Bené Criança - 'Benny' (Phellipe Haagensen) (Michel De Souza Gomes as a child) growing up on the good and more sane side of the law, and not trying to get involved with the activities of The Tender Trio or any other gang culture. The story of the two decades, and from his own perspective as well, is seen through the eyes and narrated by Buscapé - 'Rocket' (Alexandre Rodrigues) (Luis Otávio as a child), a young man who has the ambition to become a professional photographer, e.g. for a newspaper. The 1970's and 1980's see the crime rate and gang culture rule most of the slum city, but Rocket tries to stay away from it, only being drawn into the madness by his photography, which prove very lucrative. Also starring Matheus Nachtergaele as Sandro Cenoura - 'Carrot', Jonathan Haagensen as Cabeleira - 'Shaggy', Seu Jorge as Mané Galinha - 'Knockout Ned', Jefechander Suplino as Alicate - 'Clipper', Emerson Gomes as Barbantinho - 'Stringy' and Renato De Souza as Marreco - 'Goose'. The non-professional actors and the characters they play are all intriguing in their own ways, the story I did find difficult to follow in small moments, but overall it is like another GoodFellas style concept, where one of the characters anyway wanted to be a gangster since they were young, and it certainly has eye catching visuals of violence and torture, and it has a good dark tone style, it is a crime thriller to be seen. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Cinematography, Best Editing and Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay, it won the BAFTA for Best Editing, and it was nominated for Best Film not in the English Language, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film. It was number 3 on Film 4's 50 Films To See Before You Die. Very good!"
A whirlwind window to a violent world of gun-toting kids,noralee,16 March 2003,,"""City of God (Cidade de Deus)"" may be the most violent movie I've ever seen."
"""Have you lost your mind? You are just a kid!""",Marc_Israel_365,27 May 2012,10,"Brutally honest and crude, Fernando Meirielles movie, born and filmed in the Brazil slums, raises above pure cliché and inevitability. You can either be a hood, a policeman or a worker, routinely victimized and barely able to scrap a living. The experience is hard to watch at times and at others artful and fun. This is brilliant storytelling through the combination of editing, vision and narrative. The result is how personal the story becomes through the eyes of young Rocket, our protagonist photographer, whose simple desires seem to be cruelly thwarted as if this is what all kids in the favelas experience. Following the decades' trends, we see the rise and fall of the angry and insecure gangster, Ze Pequena, possibly the scariest of gangsters ever to make the big screen. Gritty and a real as it gets, City of God translates as a cool gangster film as well as a very well told universal story of survival."
A harrowing tale,ashnasran,13 October 2020,8,"This movie was a terrifying look into a very real problem that exists all over the world. City of God mainly focused on survival in the slums when all odds are against you. Gang violence and drug dealing are household terms that people talk about, but few understand the horrifying reality of loss and poverty as depicted in the film. Although a touch too violent for my taste, the film does a superb job of telling a story about survival, greed, and vengeance. Most people will probably never fully understand the world that is portrayed in the film, but the audience can not help but empathize with some of the characters. Specifically, people who try to make it out of the favelas but fail to do so, despite it being their own fault or someone else's. The movie used shock to deliver its message to the audience, particularly through cinematography and sound."
Slick and Annoying MTV Favela movie,webmaster-49,21 June 2004,,"This movie proves that foreign directors are perfectly capable of putting out soulless Hollywood crap too. This movie has nothing to say about Brazil, nothing to say about the rise of crime in Rio's shantytowns, and ultimately nothing to say about any of its characters. And to make things even worse, it ruins almost every dramatic scene by applying utterly pointless fastmo/stop sequences, the should-be-banned-forever shakycam, and the super-annoying fastcut MTV style edits that not only suck, but are hopelessly dated. The only people this movie will impress are film-critics and Tarantino-wannabes."
The life of trash,Der_Schnibbler,10 July 2009,5,"The movie is basically the story of a bunch of criminal trash who grow up robbing and murdering in a makeshift ghetto for the homeless (in which the government has tossed them) at the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro. Predictably, they grow up to become only more sociopathic and parasitical on society. Some might call them ""gangsters,"" but really people like these are merely low class, low IQ garbage that deserve death."
Simple life in a horrible world,Anijo,11 September 2007,5,"I finally got around to watching this much praised movie, and I can certainly understand why so many people have found it fascinating. It is very well done in a technical aspect, and it's easy to be seduced by the way it looks and the constant flow of action scenes, not very different from the efficiency of some glossy & clever commercial. It also shows a way of life and a part of the world that is not very well known to many outsiders, thereby invoking some sense of illumination. Unfortunately, looking beyond the interesting setting & the glossy surface there's not a lot to be found."
"Extremely somber and violent, but overall incredibly riveting",Screen_Blitz,31 May 2016,9,"Not many crime films come as dark, gritty, or even violent as this one. And unlike most crime stories set in America, this film paints a brutally honest picture of the harrowing lifestyle that dictates the third-world country of Brazil. With the visceral direction by Fernando Merielles and Katia Lund, viewers are dragged into a grueling but significantly honest experience of the difficulties in growing up in a world where violence and crime is practically a way of life than an obstacle in society. Set in the 1960s and 1970s, the film takes place in Rio De Janeiro which most people refer to as City of God, a poverty-ridden city in Brazil where employment is very low, the crime rate is devastatingly high and just about everyone from young elementary-school age children to adults carry a gun. Those are not employed resort to robbery and murder for financial support. Enter Rocket (played by Alexandre Rodrigues), a young boy growing up in the violent slums of Rio De Janeiro with the dreams of becoming of a photographer but finds his future obscured by the everyday crime including the robbery and homicide by his brother Goose (played by Renato De Souza) and his gang. Competing with his gang is Lil Ze (played by Leandro Firmino), a young boy with a thirst of violence who grows up to work his up the crime ladder to become the leader of the most dangerous gang in Rio De Janeiro. As these two gangs cross paths, the result is a war that spirals gravely out of control."
"A well-made, honest character study that takes its time; a rewarding and refreshing experience.",MovieAddict2016,11 July 2005,9,"Prior to seeing ""City of God"" I kept hearing it was like a Brazilian ""GoodFellas,"" and Total Film Magazine said it was one of the best films of the year. Then Roger Ebert said it was one of the best films he'd ever seen and it got intense praise from critics everywhere. I kept wondering why critics continued comparing its style to ""GoodFellas."" Now I know why."
"Bold, brutal and simply brilliant",areatw,17 November 2017,9,"'City of God' or 'Cidade de Deus' is one of the most realistic and brutal gangster films I have ever seen and without question one of the best foreign language films ever made. Set in the slums of Rio, it gives an shocking account of gang culture in a city where crime and violence is the natural path for most young people growing up in deprived communities."
Gifts of Crime,dannylee-78082,3 January 2023,9,"""City of God"" is a movie with many ironies."
An ironic title for an artistic movie about crime,Quebec_Dragon,23 July 2009,9,"City of God refers to a crime-ridden slum suburb in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. This movie follows the lives of several children and teenagers living there from the end of the sixties to the start of the eighties. I found this crime drama more shocking and disturbing than many traditional horror movies. Why? Because most of the characters in there are totally amoral and compassion-less, even enjoying their foul deeds. Worst, some of the offenders are children. There's not much gore but it's very violent and feels very realistic."
City of God is the Portugese version of Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas and is as good if not better in every way possible,illbebackreviews,27 January 2013,9,"I've heard from people that City of God feels a lot like a foreign version of Goodfellas and so, I've been dying to check out this movie as I loved Scorsese's Goodfellas. And I'm finally glad I did..."
Cidade de Deus.,Benedict_Cumberbatch,18 April 2011,,"I watched ""City of God"" for the first time when it was initially released on DVD in Brazil (didn't get a chance to see it in theaters, but followed its gradual and glorious popularity, which started when it premiered at Cannes 2002, out of competition). Since it was officially released in the US only in 2003, it was eligible for the Oscars the following year (but no longer for Best Foreign Film, since it was the previous year's submission and it got snubbed), earning four nominations in categories no Brazilian film had ever been recognized before: director (Meirelles, co-director Lund didn't share the nod), adapted screenplay (Braulio Mantovani, based on Paulo Lins' book), editing (Daniel Rezende), and cinematography (Cesar Charlone). I saw it again in 2007, after living in the US for one year, and the impact was even bigger; just rewatched it last week, and now, more than ever, I agree with the instant classic status this hell of a film earned."
A crime drama epic,anselmdaniel,6 February 2021,9,This review contains spoilers.
The Best Movie of the New Millennium,Eumenides_0,11 April 2009,10,"City of God is one of the most fascinating movies of the new millennium, a masterpiece in all aspects of film-making: cinematography, editing, writing and directing, assisted by solid performances by amateur child actors from Rio de Janeiro's slums."
Required Viewing for any Film Enthusiast,WriterDave,24 June 2004,8,"""City of God"" is clearly one of the most aesthetically complex and viscerally charged motion pictures ever made. There are many scenes here for students of film to take great joy in simply in terms of aesthetics. The cinematography, editing, and pacing is inventive, mind-blowing and lovingly inspired by the best work of Scorsese. I could go on and on about the opening ""chicken run"" sequence, ""Shaggy's"" death scene, the disco shoot-out, or any number of other ""WOW"" scenes of pure cinematic adrenaline."
Mind blowing!,nospam-478,16 August 2007,9,"Remarkable! You call tell that ""City of God"" is a unique film right from the titles chicken chase. An extremely well-shot, very realistic view of the other side of the world, a must see in every way,"
a bit of the old ultra violence,PIST-OFF,25 November 2005,9,"it's been a while since anything with the violent intensity of ""city of god"" has come out in the united states. this film definitely marks a good start for the director Fernando Meirelles and his use of film technique that is very similar to David Fincher, David o Russell, and Guy Ritchie. lots of frantic energy and cinged colors. one of the movie's main antagonists Lil Ze runs around like a miniature rabid Samuel l Jackson circa pulp fiction. the story centers on the criminal lives of children and young adults in Rio de Janeiro. i think that the movie while never making a political point of it lends a good amount support about just what type of anarchy results from the failed international war on drugs, including but not limited to: the creation of a black market, that gets increasingly violent as it is cracked down on, corrupt police tactics, an excess of wealth and desire for firearms for criminal purposes, international civil unrest, and a broad tool that the have-not in society may use to fore-go education in favor of black market profits. all that nonsense aside, this film is powerful in several ways."
One of the very few must-see movies from the 21st century,Rickting,27 May 2016,10,"There are awesome movies and then there's City of God. Whenever you think this brutal and devastating drama about crime in a violent neighborhood in Rio de Janeiro and 2 boys and the paths they take is dropping the pace, becoming unrealistic and going into cliché, it delivers another one of its many brilliantly directed, heart- stoppingly tense set pieces. Or another one of its quiet, beautifully written and acted character scenes. Or another one of its raw, blisteringly intense emotional beats each of which knock you out with the force of an onslaught of ballistic missiles. The actors here put many far more well-known actors to shame with their convincing, brilliant performances, while the visuals are endlessly inventive and compelling. This is a drama which doesn't hold back on any level and is filled to the brim with thought-provoking moments and compelling characters. It's a tough watch, but it's not completely depressing. It has many moments of warmth and humour, and thanks to all that tension even works as an enjoyable action movie. A fantastic film which demands to be seen. There's a good reason why this is so high on IMDb Top 250, and I hugely recommend seeing this instant classic."
Poetic justice,moviesknight,9 January 2022,9,"One of the best opening scene, you will ever see in a movie. The ganga and the gang wars, corrupt police, the hood (good and bad), drugs and guns. You think you have power, well you are kidding yourself. Revenge, cosmic justice and the streets always wins. Good story telling, pulls you in from the start till the very end. Most of the actors are kids, they have done a splendid job. Acting feels pure and raw which makes it shine more. Gets even better on rewatch."
"Well acted and well shot, but not as emotive as it claims",Danny_G13,24 April 2004,6,"I knew this was a powerful tale of despair in amongst violence, and that it was a very well received piece."
Alive and Well,thomasjay-2201,29 July 2018,9,Such a hyper stylised film might be a turn off for some but personally the breakneck pace of the film is amazing in telling such a detailed story and also keeping things light hearted in what's quite frankly a bleak existence for our protagonist 'Rocket'. An extremely enjoyable film the twist of sorts at the end is very pleasant
City of violence,Fong_Chun_Kin,29 July 2003,8,Perhaps expected too much before entering the cinema. Did not turn out as well as I thought it would.
Human Purgatory,zeekwunlau,20 April 2020,9,"In the ""Cidade de Deus"" where principles and good and evil are lost, the real harm to children is not poverty and gangsters, but the complete loss of opportunities to establish normal values. It is the distorted values of the whole society that really caused the tragedy of the children of the city of God. In the 1960s, adult citizens of the City of God provided refuge to the ""Juvenile Trio"" of looting. In the 1970s, they also actively participated in Xiao Qiao 's drug trafficking network. By the 1980s, citizen representatives directly involved in gangs emerged. : Ned. At first Ned, who was regarded as a justice representative of the citizens, was eventually killed by a dog-bitten gangfire. Maybe we still have some admiration for the citizens who support the martial arts, but Ned 's depravity shows us, Between the gang and the civilians, in fact, there is nothing but a trigger."
Surprising,JayPatton88,18 November 2017,9,"I caught this film on Starz one Monday morning, it is excellent for a foreign film. Based on a true story; shows the life of the impoverished in Brazil circa the early 1980's. No one could place a genre on this film as it covers action,crime and history. Have seen it multiple times since, a strong nine out front f ten and a film I can watch again and again! Great film!"
Amazing story further enhanced by the fact that it happened,CelluloidRehab,28 October 2004,10,"My first milestone at IMDb occurs (50th review) with this amazing movie. The plot of City of God revolves around Rocket (an aspiring photographer) as he grows up in the slums of Rio De Janeiro and the events that occur there. The cinematography is simply amazing, from the various ""action shots"", to the way the story is broken up into anachronous mini stories. It is also amazing how intertwined all the stories are. You get an idea of the cinematography from the opening scene where a chicken escapes from a restaurant and a whole gang of people go chasing after it. The scene is comical at first and then turns serious very quickly as the chicken ends up in front of Rocket with a gang of approximately 30 members armed with guns on one side and the police on the other side (Rocket and the chicken caught in the middle). This movie is very intense, but feels realistic. The violence does not seem over the top but indicative of a plausible situation. The movie is also wrought with social critique : from the drugs use, to the crime (murder,theft), to the poverty and the widespread corruption of the slums in Brazil (and the similarity to slums everywhere). There are similarities to other movies including Scarface (1983), Boyz in the Hood and Menace II Society. This movie seems more gritty, more real than those movies. This might be due to the fact that those movies dealt with adults and young adults (16-35 year old), while this movie deals primarily with children. The ending is a mixed bag of optimism and pessimism (good things do happen, but also history does repeat itself). This movie MUST be seen."
The City of God is a very good film about a God-forsaken place!,tccandler,14 June 2004,8,"This film recounts the story of a young Brazilian boy named Rocket who grows up in and around the 'City of God'.   We follow his life, from a very young age though adulthood, as he narrates all the crazy adventures of his life and describes all the various characters he encounters along the way.  His life is a tough one, filled with horrific violence, incessant theft and rampant drug abuse, which seems commonplace in his world.  More than anything, this is a story of survival in a vicious community that chews people up and only spits them out if they are lucky.  This existence is a vicious circle that seem to inevitably lead to short life or a life spent in jail or absolute poverty.  The only way out seems to be to risk your life in the drug trade where things become assuredly more dangerous.  Avoiding trouble completely is a very tricky accomplishment and we watch as Rocket does his best to make it in this God-forsaken world.  But will he make it without giving in to the temptations of a criminal life?  After all, honesty doesn't pay in the 'City of God'. The film is marvelously directed and edited.  There is a kinetic feel that rivals Scorsese's work in 'Goodfellas'.  That the material is also similar is not surprising.  This film was clearly inspired by the 1990 gangster epic.  'City of God' definitely deserved its Oscar nominations. I am clearly recommending the film despite the brutality and the overwhelming sense of despair that the film conveys.  I usually don't like films that refuse to feature even a glimmer of hope, but this film avoids that pitfall in the final twenty minutes.  I won't reveal what happens, but the film offers a sliver of hope without selling out the reality and tone of the earlier scenes. Based on true events, 'City of God' is a visceral and shocking peek into a living hell that, by all accounts, still exists to this day.  Poverty will always make crime a viable option... a natural human instinct.  This film highlights that fact with brilliant direction and Oscar worthy editing.  I am not sure anyone would want to watch this film multiple times, it's just not that kind of movie.  But I strongly suggest you seek it out on DVD if you missed the limited theatrical run."
Just one of those films with furious and intense energy.,Cocacolaguy912-2,9 July 2007,10,"City of God falls under the pile of unflinching movies, movies that aren't afraid to be brutally realistic. If you are going to tell a story about gang wars, corrupt police, and hardship, you can't make it PG-13 and turn your camera every time someone gets shot. That just feels so fake. It is fake! This film tells it like it is. It is true to the story and to life. That is one reason I think City of God is great - its upsetting and powerful because it is furiously real."
Love city of god,umlaziking,11 July 2020,10,"This film is unique and extremely excellent. Follows the life of rocket living his life in the city of god, which is full of gangs and a lot of violence. Definitely one of the greatest of the greats."
"Amazing, Take-Your-Breath-Away Work of Art!",WaltDittrich,5 May 2005,10,Just finished watching this great film - 5/4/05. Wow! This was so amazingly great.
Riveting Docudrama on youth crime in South America,imbluzclooby,15 December 2005,8,"I had never heard of ""City of God' until two years after it's release. It's a masterpiece. This is definitely excellent film making. The story is very well told and explained about youth gang wars in Brazil. This movie is based entirely on fact and doesn't sugar coat any of the grisly or horrific details. It's fascinating to see that this was seen and filmed through the eyes of one who wanted to go straight laced and avoid being drawn by the gang wars lair. These kids are practically all teenagers from 16 to 19 years of age. They are armed, street wise, crime savvy and drug addicts. The narrative is quite clear without ever getting abundant. Some scenes are done in the hyper fast forward motion to illustrate a typical day for these kids whether discussing drugs in the slums, having sex, or getting shot and beaten. This movie is like the South American version of ""Boyz in the Hood"", only better and more true."
"'City of God' is A Place Where Life is Cheap, But Humanity is Richly Vibrant!",sandnair87,8 February 2016,10,"Brazillian director Fernando Meirelles' splashy feature debut is a dynamically exciting portrait of Rio de Janeiro's violent gangs - a blood-spattered, non-stop ride as much into the life of a 'favela' (squatter settlement) as it is into the lives of the youths who inhabit it."
AN ENORMOUSLY EFFECTIVE INDICTMENT OF POVERTY,gregorybnyc,24 June 2004,10,I was rather surprised by some of the negative reviews about this
great movie,fanan450,7 June 2019,8,"This is the first time I see a Brazilian movie , and I was surprised . the story was perfect , the acting and the shooting scenes were great and too realistic. I really enjoyed watching it , and I recommend it to all."
Shallow and senseless,edvin-6,12 December 2009,1,"I watched this movie with great expectations, believing that the extremely high IMDb rating is probably well deserved. Unfortunately, that's not the case. Acting is very poor, screenplay is a confused mess of violence, there is absolutely no character development or any credible story, just a shallow, senseless stream of murders and shootouts."
A stunningly good film,roger-pettit1,23 June 2012,10,"""City of God"" is a quite brilliant film that portrays three decades - the 1960s, the 1970s and the 1980s - of child and adult drugs gang warfare in the slums (favelas) outside Rio de Janeiro. Its quality is all the more astonishing given that many of its stars are non-professional actors who seemingly act out their own personal experiences for the camera."
The most realistic movie ever made!,raphaklopper,16 April 2013,10,"CITY OF GOD, critically acclaimed, loved by many, considered the best movie in Brazilian cinema, this is all true ...? Yes, probably."
What's the big deal?,WordtwisterMN,14 March 2005,8,"I have seen some documentaries on how Brazilian police can storm homes with no warrants. And Brazilian shop-owners will pay to murder homeless children because they steal from them. The movie has an 8.7 of 10 rating on IMDb.com. This is an incredible rating, needless to say. I found the camera work far above the norm. The direction was good, but I felt they stole a bit from Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. Also, the story has been done before...poor community, drug dealing, corrupt cops, etc. I think the movie could have rocked if it was 25 minutes shorter, the characters more descriptive and understanding. After viewing the movie, it's difficult for me to understand how it received such high ratings. I found this movie no where near the top 100. It has no place among the best. The photography alone should not justify an 8.7. The story was full of holes, and again, it had been told before in hundreds if not thousands of other cultures."
"I don't know how to evaluate this film, but this film is a true portrayal of reality to some extent.",InlyCii,17 April 2020,9,"Unlike other films, it promotes positive energy and values. We have seen the weakness, ugliness and killing of human nature. There is no law or reason to see the city of God. The softness of the fist symbolizes the size of power. The bullet is the way to rule everything. The gangster colludes. The end of the movie returns to the origin of the story. The city is still in chaos. The city is just a big wave of sand, and there are batches of gangsters fighting for the throne of ""rights"", constantly changing."
Amazing - I've never seen anything like it,ceciliajuarez-55831,7 October 2019,10,"The City of God (2002) executes every aspect of an Oscar-worthy film. Cinematographer Cesar Charlone does an exceptional job of conveying real-life in the slums of Rio de Janeiro during the 1960s through the use of color, lighting, music, sound, camera angles, and moving camera shots. Most of the film's shots consists of handheld shots which create a documentary-like film and feels very life-like. In other words, it's almost as if you yourself are living in the City of God."
A violent cartoon,peruviansilver,27 August 2006,1,"I was really disappointed with this film. It is sold as a sort of triumph of the human spirit film, but it is more like a typical mafia gangster film transplanted to Brazil and the seventies. I was waiting for the Godfather to come out any minute and say ""He takes out a knife, yah take out a gun."" Scene after scene is of someone getting killed and the deaths have all the depth and meaning of a pixel creature getting shot in a video game. This film entertains on the most base level and has no depth whatsoever."
Review,halimaxoxo,7 October 2019,9,"The film was something very unexpected and interesting. I did not think that it would be something that I would enjoy or even think to watch. It made me question many things in society and within my own life. We live in a very sheltered society and it might make us more desensitized to the struggles of people across the world. We start to think in terms of ""us vs. them""."
Wrenching film is both harrowing and exhilarating,rosscinema,1 February 2005,8,There are very few films that can capture what life is really like in virtually unknown areas and even though I have never been to the slums of Rio de Janeiro audiences will undoubtedly get a sense of the horror that takes place there. Story is about the drug wars that take place in the isolated slums in Rio and the central character is a young man named Rocket (Alexandre Rodrigues) who acts as our narrator and tells us early on that he always wanted to be a hood. In flashbacks we see in the 1960's that the brother of Rocket who was in a well known gang ended up getting killed which convinces him to try and stay clear of the hoods.
"With an array of resonating performances and flawless direction, it is sure to be one of the greatest films one will ever see.",annoman,7 August 2007,10,"One of the most powerful dramas of the decade is 'City of God.' Fernando Meirelles proves that he can run with the most acclaimed directors in modern cinema with this film. His disciplined style is vigorously enchanting as much as it is appealing. For his furious and violent tale, 'City of God,' he portrays, with shocking realism, the slums of Rio de Janeiro from the late 60's to the mid 80's, where crime was the way out and those not involved were the suckers. But among these criminals and suckers is a minority of those dedicated the goodness that is often overlooked in cities as torn as Rio, and Meirelles exemplifies that notion through a young photographer and the story he comes to tell."
A splendid movie,muons,16 April 2018,9,"This is a movie about young people who live in the guts of Rio de Jeneiro. It starts with a scene where a gang of children chase a running chicken and suddenly flashbacks to 60s to set up the background for the main theme. After that, more than 90% of the movie are dedicated to laying the ground work for the opening scene, which is indeed the overture of the finale and a substantial amount of mental effort is needed to piece together the events which unfold at a very fast pace and involve a lot of characters. Despite its patchy storytelling style with full of flashbacks, the movie is coherent without any plot holes. Although a good deal of the actors are recruited amateurs from the favela the acting is pretty good and director's portrayal of the gang leader Ze Pequeno is uncompromising. The movie's fast tempo and action packed scenes doesn't leave any room for character development but this doesn't really stick out. Viewing more than once will probably be needed to grasp the whole story with its details."
A Blistering Brazilian Snapshot,zacharyklozik,7 October 2019,9,"City of God or Cidade de Deus is a high-intensity roller-coaster ride that does not allow you to exit. The movie is based on the real events that happened in the City of God in Brazil, and it shows the brutality of a city that is strangled by gang wars and drug addictions."
Crime doesn't pay for anyone,StoryCharts,10 August 2013,5,"City of God is a movie about the idea that crime doesn't pay for anyone. It goes about demonstrating this idea by showing a succession of people trying to take over the ghetto with violence. Some of the candidates are kind-hearted Robin Hoods (Tender Trio), some are accidental gangsters (Knockout Ted), some are simply evil (Lil'Z) and some are a bunch of prepubescent kids (Runts). They all use violence to pursue crime. They all fail. Even as the Runts seem to rule the day at the end, having killed Lil'Z, you know things can change tomorrow (they're like, 10 years old). These four external plots are joined by an internal plot of our protagonist, Rocket, successfully avoiding a life of crime by luck and some fortitude."
Class flick,ivanterry101,27 May 2006,10,Much better than Million Dollar baby should have gotten the Oscar. Well that's the academy for you - It's our own fault for watching them I suppose. I don't know what else to say other than that if you don't watch this film then you're missing out on an experience and adventure .
City of Gritty,kechhh,18 March 2013,,"Normally, I don't enjoy movies based on true stories, but this one is an exception."
"A Moving, Powerful, and Compelling Story",arlmovies,4 March 2005,10,"The basic story, a boy who is raised in the real world, from the beginning of his life. I believe this is one of the most powerful, and truly realistic stories, that can truly show the hardships of reality, and the decisions given to people, and how they choose to accept different opportunities. When I first saw this movie, I thought it was all those things: powerful,moving, beautiful and all that, but I realized this is a story that should be heard. This story reminds me of Lord of the Flies, with realism in it. This movie deserves all the credit it gets and some, and I hope that the situation that this story follows, one day, will no longer exist: life of violence, drugs, and death."
Amazing Latin American Brazilian Movie,Rifat_Rock_Don,3 May 2020,10,"Nice Story, greet Screenplay and good Cinematography. This movie presented the dangerous gangster rise and fall. Such a masterpiece movie. every actor play best performance on his character. Over all great movie ending."
Good Story; Good Acting; Good Backdrop,chubbydave,31 August 2013,10,This movie is a story about some people living in a Rio de Janeiro favela called A Cidade de Deus. It's an actual place built about 50 years ago that's one of the most well known favelas in Brasil.
Awe inspiring,ryanb90,27 March 2021,10,"I'm in awe every time I watch this film. Every scene, every piece of music, every actor is in complete unison with one another. A perfectly structured, incredibly told gem of a film. Masterpiece."
Tarantino Lovers...,IMSandman,28 June 2005,10,I give City of God a brilliant 10 stars.
"Believable and welcome South American life-in-the-ghetto diary, but ultimately too character cluttered, repeating and limited.",Pedro_H,26 December 2004,7,"The violent, and often shambolic, life and times of the Rio de Janeiro favela (or slum) told from the point of view of two contrasting former schoolboy friends. Filmed in the modern ""shaky hand-held camera"" fashion to give it a documentary look-and-feel."
Brilliant,andrewfleming-57891,8 August 2018,9,This film is amazing. City of God tells the true story of a young Brazilian boy growing up in Rio debJaneiro and his attempts to avoid the local gangs.
"Awesome movie, deserves to be top 5!",ecooley1,12 March 2009,10,This movie is amazing! The plot is strong and very thick without ever becoming pretentious or slow. The action scenes are very gritty and real and not full of Hollywood overindulgence and the violence is framed more for poignancy than shock value. It is obviously very influenced by scorscese but has a modern twist. It seems like a blend of Scorscese's camera work and storytelling with the backdrop of urban ghetto dramas like New Jack City or Boyz N the Hood. Even though the movie is subtitled you never feel like you have to watch the bottom of the screen to stay in the movie. You could almost watch the movie on mute and still soak up ninety percent of the film.
"Dazzling, dizzying, but ultimately just another shoot-em-up",Robert-63,14 February 2004,1,"Being based on a true story, having lots of non-actors, making some very imaginative choices in cinematography, and so forth, this film really throws a lot of stuff at you, and it is impressive in its ability to keep a great many plates spinning in the air (although to tell the truth, if the narrator had said ""but it's not time to tell So-and-so's story yet"" just one more time, I would have screamed)."
Dark as you get,judemcrobbie,30 January 2021,9,"Visually I still maintain that that and is the most disturbing movie however this is easily the most mentally disturbed movie I've seen yet.
Performance are stellar across the board, each actor perfectly reflecting their emotion and thinking behind their character's actions.
The nonchalance of the by-passers sums up the poverty-stricken streets. This is how they see children as young as 5 running around and not even bat an eyelid.
Knockout Ned's character arc keeps you emotionally invested as it presents the nurture side of the nature vs nurture argument-How he only becomes a 'hood' because of actions that happen to him. Alternatively, Li'l Z's arc is showing the side of nature-'having the knack for crime' and being a gangster from young.
The dialogue throughout the movie feels poetic, almost like riddles at times. This presents subtly how no one really knows what's going on.
My only issue with the movie is I wish the ending had been foreshadowed better. I enjoyed the way it was done however it seemed almost forced in.
It presents fear and dread as tangible objects that can be turned off or on.
The repeated lines drum home the the themes of the movie: mainly nature vs nurture but also the ethical debate of what's ok to do to get out of poverty.
There is some truly graphic images. Live deaths of anyone child or adult, and the youthful hope of children juxtaposed to the disparo of guns.
The only person to refer to the city as Rio de Janeiro and not City of God is not from there, showing the false hope and almost irony of God helping them out of their situation.
The editing and cinematography are chilling. Furthered by the panning shots, claustrophobic narrow shots and shaky handheld camera shots making you truly feel the intensity of the action.
Every shot feels perfectly constructed and needed to be there.
9/10 so close to a 10"
"First Half Is Bland, but The Final Half... (:Q______) Just STUNNING!",Kop_Reaz,2 March 2015,8,"I don't know how to begin. It's one of those films you can't explain easily to anyone else but yourself. Then you have to, yes you have to watch City of God just once in your life."
PERFECT FILM,nizzambaharuddin,9 January 2023,10,"City of God or much more known as Cidade de Deus in Portuguese, have often featured on most people's best films of all time list. So as per usual me being myself, I was curious to see why the film is so popular."
God left this city,firmanfmn,6 January 2019,9,"City of god tells a story of ""Rocket a slum boy who wants to be photographer,but caught up in a war between rival gang in the city of god"""
"good film, but waaaaay overrated",simonp81,15 September 2006,7,"I watched City of God a couple of years ago and was blown away on first viewing. I recently decided to watch it again the other night and was rather disappointed. Basically, COD is a massive case of style over substance - there's basically not much underneath the flashy exterior. For this film to be rated at number 18 in the top 250 is very hard to believe and I would presume that this is due to younger viewers being taken in by its easy charms (I'm only 24 myself though)."
"Drugs,guns,gangs and Samba",ramsri81,31 March 2005,10,"Seriouslly this movie is one of the best gangster movies ever made.The way the story is being told,the characters involved in the story,acting of the actors are just brilliant.The story of drugs and people of worlds most notorious slum in Brazil was brilliantly shot and recreated.People who think staying in Brazil was all about paradise, really need to see this one to see how things were around the 60's and 70's.Definitely a collector's item.I have no possible glitches in the whole film to give it less than 10( a little bit of violence,but if its a real incident it shouldn't be cut!!!!!!!).It said on the DVD cover that THE GOODFELLAS of BRAZIL, I would say they really meant it."

National Geographic meets Goodfellas?,coldwaterpdh,29 April 2008,8,"""City of God"" is a really awesome film. I enjoyed it. I have not, however, watched it since viewing it for the first time about 6 months ago. I haven't felt the need."
"Cidade de Deus, a picture by Fernando Meirelles.",josepaulo-72710,8 June 2021,10,"Cidade de Deus is a movie that tells us the story of a city, the city of god.

The Best Movie I've Seen For A Long Time!,Dead_Mann,16 June 2006,10,"like i said its definitely the best movie I've seen for awhile, and i have it on my top 100, its disturbing but still very very good........."
A Glory to Portuguese language,becascaeiro44,17 January 2013,9,"As a Portuguese boy, i just like to say that this film been so well quoted on IMDb makes me so proud. in my opinion, this is a very good movie and deserves this quotation. there's no more movie in the entire world that describes so well with such brilliance the life at the slum. The drugs, the organized crime, the corrupt cops and poverty and misery is so well represented by the Brazilian actors. The character "" Zé Pequeno"" represents the crime the everyday life of drugs and crime in the slums that causes such insecurity in great cities in Brazil India and Mexico. I totally recommend this one to young boys and girls but also to adult audience."
This city will not be as beautiful as on the postcard,DemonKiki,28 April 2020,9,"Smooth and skilled editing skills and dazzling picture texture are the first heroes of this film's unique style, and the outstanding performances of amateur actors beyond the age limit are rare. Multiple narrative methods allow reality and fiction to display a fateful reincarnation in the interweaving of each other. This story is not only an excellent reproduction of a specific place and a specific era, but also an exploration and description of the common ground of human nature. It is neither cynical nor artificial, and it has a general style."
10 out of 10 -- just perfect,ejderkelebek,3 April 2007,10,"What one expects in a film can differ. But the film itself suits the audience. This film did very well to me. Perfect cinematography, perfect story telling, perfect story, that which is very important for the world, gangs and the children soldiers. Sociology, philosophy, truth. This film has all of those. Takes us to pace where we cannot enter. And enters in them tells the stories. Not only one but many stories of many people. This film explains all. That is perfect director, perfect film and I am just amazed. It really pays its #17 in top 250 of IMDb list. Stunning. Also proves the IMDb writers and readers sense of rating. If you did not watch it you have to hurry."
film craftsmanship!,aristofanis,18 February 2003,10,"This isn't an easy subject matter to make a masterpiece out of it, but Meirelles has done it! This story is told in the most skilful of ways! All its bits and pieces are carefully placed and events are uncovered with flashbacks then when they really matter most! Innovating filmmaking molds the scenes and the acting is flawless. Yes, it is perhaps one of the most violent films I've seen but I don't think it is for the sake of spectacle or that it is a cold portrayal of gangs in Rio.  This is a film with a striking social commentary. It exposes all levels and aspects of poverty and social inequalities in Rio and strikes us with the sheer magnitude of a problem that is real and ongoing! We see the fatalism of the ghetto, the corruption of the police, a society that never rewards good faith, the indifference of the system to intervene (""let them kill themselves"" says the policeman), a system that supports the erosion and the self destruction of the masses. The protagonist is too human. He is the link between us and the jungle. The whole story is about a deep helplessness! Even ""bad"" Ze is really a helpless figure.  Allow me to say that I think that movies like ""The Lord of the Rings"" is more violent in essence. 9/10 No doubt the best movie of the year."
One of the Saddest Movies you will ever see,jpintar,14 June 2004,10,"City of God about life in the slums of Rio De Janiero may be one of the saddest movies I have ever seen.  The movie shows an endless cycle of kids becoming criminals before they are even 12 years old.  It seems that when these children are 18 years old, they will either be dead or in prison. This movie tells the story of one of the few who managed to get out of the slums alive.  It is heartbreaking to watch children who are 8, 9, or 10 years old becoming criminals because it is the only way they can money for food.  When they get older, they eventually start helping out with the drug dealers.  The police only show up every once in a while and don't do much. The drug dealers pays the cops to look the other way.  So long as no rich people get killed, nobody cares.  This is simply one of the most poignant films I have ever seen.  10/10"
Mean and cruel,alantas,5 June 2007,10,"I saw City of god two days ago on the national TV. I was shocked. For me it's more than massacre, that's what I read on a Hungarian site. The critic also said that poverty and violence are cheap export merchandise. It's good fuel for any film and keeps you in your seat. I can't argue with that. Definitely it kept me in my seat, but not only because it's extremely violent. The most important for me is atmosphere. And Cidade de Deus really has it. Pulls you in, and won't let go. I felt the choking air full of dust in the favella. The story is fast, the characters are great. Real? I don't think so. But it gives you a strong feeling, an impression about misery and you think: that's like when god leaves his children alone. If you watch closely you can find humor and irony."
City of God,EdgarST,22 December 2003,6,"Some people have complained of the ""Hollywood treatment"" this story (inspired by real events) received, and it can't be denied that most of its stylistic flourishes resembles senseless action films. Somehow, though, the violence depicted in the movie has no ultimate sense, no other purpose than to follow the flow of daily life in the slums of Brazil, even more when it has been decided to disconnect the events from the social and economic structures of the Brazilian society. (Compare this movie with Héctor Babenco's ""Pixote"", and you'll see the difference.) It is obvious that some persons who are not aware of those conditions may find the images too raw or blame them on the characters' psychopath behavior. But then (I hope) neither we find reasons for the behavior of Quentin Tarantino's or John Woo's characters only on individual psychological terms. In the end, it's such a harsh reality that the cynicism of the filmmakers and all their flashy and effectist resources (like the change of music and the introduction of a strobe light in a party, just before one of the less repulsive young criminals is killed) end buried below the piles of dead bodies of Brazilian children and adolescents."
director in overdrive tells familiar story of poverty = a really awful existence,parsleylion,4 March 2004,6,"City of God is about a district in Rio or some Brazilian city where poverty is rife and known as the city of god. Told through the eyes of one of the inhabitants who witnesses the growth of crime amongst the young men and boys of the area, the story is supposed to be true and unhappily it looks an honest enough assessment of any rundown poverty stricken urban neighbourhood no body cares about. the cycle of crime sounds familiar, using kids as couriers for drugs, random killings, turf wars, addiction, hopelessness, squalor and filth. told at a fast pace in a episodic story character by character, the place soundslike one step up from a concentration camp [see the work of Primo Levi about what thats like] Oddly the storyteller goes on to leave the ghetto by becoming a photojournalist, a similar story was told here on Irish TV by a young man who was in trouble from age 8 till his early 20's when he learnt to write and became a journalist so he could break the cycle of damaging behaviour he had. the truth is to get an education seriously as characters in the film are constantly telling the storyteller but he gets out by luck mainly and having a strong character. not a brilliant film, a relentlessly told story, violent and depressing, though honest 10 out of 10 for that; it should be labelled a docudrama rather than a film  but then less people would see it, but I wonder if I or anyone really know what it means? If this goes on in Brazil and Ireland why not everywhere in which case ...."
Brilliant,grantss,22 December 2015,10,Brilliant.
THAT great?,KingM21,22 April 2006,6,"Over the course of 25 years or so, we are told the (true?) story of several poor youths who grow up in the slums of Brazil, leading to a life of violence, drugs, and organized crime. The focus, though, is usually on Buscapé, a young man who chooses not to dive head first into the grime but to simply try and work his way through it. He also has a penchant for photography, which is just the ticket he needs. City of God is similar, both in style and content, to the likes of Pulp Fiction and Goodfellas. Trendy camera-work, (semi-)hip dialogue and humor, shocking, brutal violence, and a mob-like plot line are all aspects of it and actually done decently. The scene in which a boy must choose to be shot either in his hand or foot is a favorite! That all said, there was something about this movie that I did not like and I can't put my finger on itI just didn't leave the theater thinking it was THAT great. And a ranking of 16 (48 when I wrote this review back in February of 2004) on IMDb? I just don't see that. It wasn't a bad movie though."
Not perfect but certainly close enough!,Boba_Fett1138,27 December 2011,8,For me this was not a perfect movie but it still was a very good one!
Rapid Money kills rapidly,trouble50,14 December 2020,10,"The film is produced with hidden camera as if. Scene and camera angels are incredible and orjinal. Film pushes u to real world. Succesion of characters and perfect accomodition with each others. Film is fascinating as u dont understand how to time passed.
we dont need talk about the film bcs u can always face to similars on news or newspapers. It just more detailed than . I wanna emhasize to constantly stayed innocent main charachter he already got this award with increasing life standart level. As much as I see people could not being patience for this. U have to break taboos and be patience"
An Adrenaline Rush,Percivalx,7 May 2007,10,"On the front cover of the DVD, Roger Ebert proclaims City of God is: One of the Best Films You'll Ever See! I don't agree with some of his reviews but man, was he right on this one! It blew me away! It is an amazing true story of a young Brazilian man living in the slums of the City of God and who dreams of becoming a photographer. The camera not only keeps him in the slums but also serves as a way out. The story is told through his eyes and in the process we're introduced to some of the most interesting and complex heroes and villains to ever appear on screen. It is a tour-de-force production that has merit in many areas. From the vast array of amateur actors who did a splendid job realizing each character with raw energy to the ultra-kinetic editing and camera movement. This type of frantic editing actually contributed greatly to the effectiveness of the film. Despite some dark and even disturbing moments, director Fernando Meirelles brilliantly puts it all together. It's fast-paced, realistic, and superbly written. Without any doubt, City of God is one of the greatest foreign films ever made."
I want two hours of my life back,slowboatmo,3 June 2008,1,"An awful, awful movie. Like one of the viewers said, it is cheap in all aspects. To those people who haven't seen this film, please stay away from this junk at all cost. Go Watch some wholesome, soul-lifting contemporary Russian art movies like the Return and then see how cheap this movie is. But this is totally a piece of stinking garbage. Violence need not to be portrayed in such an outlandish, vulgar style. The camera movement almost made me throw up. Editing is almost not-existent. A cheap, cheap movie that to the greatest irony won so many undeserving awards. People who raved about this film are idiots. Critics too. It is just pathetic. Even Hollywood movies are one hundred times better as much as I don't like them."
A master piece!,benbhodgson,18 September 2020,10,Everything a film should be!
A masterpiece,cnogueira51,25 March 2021,10,"For me, it is one of the best films ever. It's in my heart."
Actually really good.,VictorBergvall,25 April 2022,8,"This movie portrays the Gangs of Rio in Cidade de Deus, how difficult it is being a child, and how much drugs and killing there is."
great movie made with a low budget,MLDinTN,21 October 2004,,"Why can't Hollywood get it right with all these big budget movies, when a small film like this does it the right way. First, the script was great as well as the cinematography. It's no wonder those things as well as the director got nominated for so many awards. It's a wonder it didn't win for best foreign film. The movie was based on real events about a boy named Rocket who lives in the slums of Rio. Many kids there turn to a life a crime and he witnesses all of it. Two warring gangs take over the streets. He gets the opportunity to take pictures of it and gets them in the newspaper. At the end it tells us he won awards for the pictures he took, including a death picture of the boss of the City of God."
A Cinematic Feat,mdrohan,5 May 2005,9,"City of God, co-directed by Fernando Meirelles and Katia Lund, is a gripping tale about life in the slums, or favelas, of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. In particular, the film follows the story of a boy named Rocket, who is determined to not become a street hood like most young boys his age, and instead become a photographer. Another main character the film chronicles is Lil' Ze, a determined youth with the end goal of taking over all of the illegal drug operations and other activities in the favela."
Enter my top 10 easily.,i_know_i_die,28 February 2007,10,"Imagine Pulp Fiction with more characters, more guns, more stories, different language, lots of gun fights and a chicken. If you love Pulp Fiction, you will love this."
violence begets violence,widescreenguy,15 January 2007,7,the abundance of handguns says it all.
God's city. City of Destiny.,aruslanzhabbarovkrut,19 January 2022,8,"The first shots of the film show a sharp blade being carelessly sharpened on a rough whetstone. The purpose of the blade is to cut off the heads of chickens and clean off grayish feathers from their dead fragile carcasses. Chickens are doomed. They see everything that is happening around. They see the heads of their former comrades and neighbors fly off with colorful fountains of spray. They see how shiny knives plunge into helpless lifeless ribs. But they can't do anything, even if they wanted to."
"Good, very good",Padrese,28 February 2005,9,"Wow,really good movie. The action of the movie is placed in the rough hoods in Rio and presents the hard life there or how the narrator says:""City of Gods has nothing to do with the Rio De Janeiro you see in postcards"" It has everything-love,war,revenge,crime,funny.The movie can be seen in two opposite ways- of the child who wants to escape from the rough world and of the rest of the children from there who think the only place to make something in life is there. The actors match very well with the story ,also the director Fernando Mirelles done a very good job. In conclusion this movie deserve his spot in the top of the best movies ever made."
No words....,morbid_Visions,12 February 2004,10,"I'm sitting here having trouble coming up with the words for this film. From start to ending you're thrust into such a great story (beautifully shot and directed as well) that keeps getting better and really has no slow spots. Another thing I loved is that the subtitling was masterfully done in the aspect that it fits perfectly in the scenes so its nearly impossible to miss action due to reading the titles. The characters are excellently portrayed and you'll just love Rocket, the main character who narrates the whole movie. I just can't describe in words how this movie makes me feel and how just so incredible it is. Everyone needs to see this now for it cannot be missed. Its got drama, comedy, violence, action, everything. So let the screen saver on your comp kick on and head to your local theater and see it NOW."
Oscars ain't enough,moudjimmy,17 April 2020,9,"How typical of the academy to snub off a masterpiece like this. Based on a true story with relentless risk and breakthrough cinematography and still no Oscar to go home with. That aside, this is genuine film and the reason why more needs to be exposed of what really happens in Brazil."
Brilliant,laura-vanbaren,10 November 2008,10,"You know, a classmate of mine told me for years I had to see this movie, and since we like the same kind of movies, I just knew it had to be great. Still, it lasted for about 3 years 'til I actually saw the movie."
"""City of God"" tells yet another story of violence in a unique way",Movie_Muse_Reviews,23 September 2008,9,"The cycle of violence is not a subject filmmakers have ever shied away from. There are plenty of films like ""City of God"" that try and show such gratuitous violence that we almost become desensitized to it, we expect it. However, there is no film like ""City of God"" that tells this kind of story in rich, visual detail using some very compelling visual storytelling techniques."
a mixture of brilliance and utter disturbance,nbpatel,22 April 2004,10,"this movie is pseudo-documentary meets Little Rascals meets Peter Parker meets Scarface meets Godfather meets Lord of the Flies meets so many other classics.  it's not derivative at all, but it certainly makes you compare elements to the all-time greats of entertainment."
Effectively brutal,Vartiainen,11 October 2014,7,"Based on a novel by Paulo Lins who based the plot on real events having taken place in a favela, Brazilian slum, called City of God. The story is one of lost, unforgiving odds, bleak chances, little to no chance of escaping and of friends turned enemies."
One of the best movies ever made,NoeMan,9 April 2004,10,"This is without a doubt one of the most brilliant films ever made. It tells the story of a few boys that grow up in the ""city of god"", an outskirt of Rio De Janeiro where the poor live. A city where children carry guns and need to steal to have enough food to stay alive. The boys go in different directions as they grow up, one becomes a photographer while another becomes the most powerful criminal in town. Over 100 people are killed in this movie and many of them are kids so it might not be for everyone."
"Hell is Raised, in the City of God",DarylKMiddlebrook,18 September 2015,10,"Set in Brazil in the 1970s, the film tells the story of Rocket (Alexandre Rorigues in an excellent, understated performance), a teenage boy living in an extremely violent area of Rio de Janeiro called The City of God. Like most boys his age, all Rocket wants is to get laid, smoke a little blow and chill with his friends. However, the violence around him not only complicates this it throws him smack dab in the middle of it. When he loses his low paying job, he watches with envy the carefree life of the drug lords Lil Zee and Benny (Leandro Firmino and Phellipe Haagensen respectively) who run the ghetto. They flash money and ride brand new motor scooters through the streets of the hood. When he loses his girl to the more enigmatic gangster Benny, Rocket declares in frustration, ""It was like a message from God: Honesty doesn't pay, sucker."" Seeing delinquency as the only way to prosper, Rocket decides to pursue criminal ventures of his own. Fortunately, Rocket and his equally square buddy, prove to be the most inept of criminals. They don't even have the heart to rob a lost drunk who has unwittingly gotten lost in the slums. Rocket soon resigns himself to the fact he's no criminal. He's one of the nobodies. One of the thousands whose fate is in the hands of a few crazy fools with guns. Luckily for Rocket, fate was waiting around the corner with a better hand for him to play."
Me so not worthy...,Sinnerman,6 May 2003,10,I'll be damned!
One of my PERSONAL top ten movies of all time.,zv300,29 May 2006,9,"This movies is absolutely AMAZING, and for the most part holds up to the hype that surrounds it. I won't get into the story as a few hundred people have already described the gist of the story, but I'll tell you what makes it so good. First the subject matter is important and timely. This movie brings attention to the rampant crime and homelessness in Brazil, especially amongst young children. All the characters are interesting but the editing and camera angles are amongst the best I have ever seen, definitely in my top 5 best edited movies. Hell, you even get the perspective of a chicken being chased by a dozen trigger-happy gangsters! At first your bombarded with scenes from different time-lines, but in the end it all comes to fruition and is explained in an ingenious manner. Everybody pretty much is a gangster in this film (even kids) leaving no one to empathize with, so you have to empathize with their SITUATION, meaning that you feel empathy for EVERYONE involved because all the characters seemed to have been abused and are dirt-poor, living in a barrio in which you have to kill and rob to survive. There is one scene in which a child is coerced into making a choice of killing one of two OTHER children about his age as an initiation. The younger of the two victims actually pees his pants and starts crying like the child he should be acting like. Mind you, this now victim had earlier been stealing and beating other victims himself, but when faced with death reverted back to a child-like state. Mind you, him AND his buddy have both been shot in the foot as punishment for all their stealing. The scene is so realistic that you almost think it's real. And the acting? Absolutely Phenomenal acting from EVERYBODY, especially the youngest children. That's saying a lot because almost everybody in the film ARE actually from the Barrio, with no formal acting experience whatsoever. In other words after filming these kids went back to the ghetto. After seeing this movie I'm positive Hollywood actors make too much money for the crap they put out and call a movie. Anyway, in no way does this film glamorize violence or the gangs as almost anyone involved in the gangster lifestyle pretty much meets a violent demise at the end. This movie in no way tries to preach or even offer a solution for the poverty and violence in Brazil, it's just a snapshot of a day in the life of the barrios and slums of Brazil, the cold hard truth of a region that basks in the sun by day only to hide from the overwhelming violence by night. This film is as important and telling to Brazil as Joint Security Area is to the Korean peninsula. A must see by any standard."
Looks like a funeral procession.,FilmCriticLalitRao,20 July 2007,8,"In Paris,France after having met Katia Lund in 2006,it was difficult for me to fathom that this soft spoken charming lady has made a very violent film depicting the rise of violence in Brazilian slums.She told the audience that it is quite normal for Brazilians to live with violence as they have adjusted themselves to it.This is a very serious statement which in some way reflects the honesty on the part of Brazilian filmmakers. They are showing what is happening in their society and by doing so there are being truthful.The violence of City of God is realistic and no makeup has been done to it.The three key elements of the film: melodrama,violence and music compliment each other well.This film also has a procession like quality to it.It is as if the audience is watching some sort of procession going on and willy-nilly,they also decide to be a part of the crowd.On watching this film,I had the impression of a fun activity happening before me. May be others will experience that too."
The 7th Greatest Film of All Time,aprilzh,5 January 2020,10,"City of God tells the semi-autobiographical story of one young man's experiences growing up alongside the gangs of one of Brazil's most natorious slums in the 1970's. It's stylish. It's groovy and hip. Those things in and of themselves don't make a great movie. But here they serve the story in a remarkable way. The music of the decade and the documentary-like camerawork and slick editing all enhance the experience. The way in which the lead character's everyday struggles are expertly and fluidly intertwined with the rise and fall of the neighborhood gangs is astounding as he brushes shoulders with various characters on both sides of the law. And the narration, which I don't normally enjoy in films, is some of the best I've come across. Very well done."
One of the greatest films of our time,GavAnderson,4 September 2005,10,"'City of God' is hands down, one of the best films ever made. The script is brilliant, the story brutal, and the acting first class. Its stylish, sharp, and hard hitting telling a story of what life is like in one of the world's most notorious slums. It reminds me of 'Goodfellas' in many ways, only it's a whole lot better. Fernando Meirelles has an awesome style, his directing is fast paced and stylish from beginning to end I especially love the way he skips back and forth through time in order to tell every aspect of the story. It is a very stylish film but it also has a heart, it has a story to tell, a story worth watching. 'City of God' is unlike any film I have ever seen, it is so rich is visual beauty, and is flooded with bold originality. You will struggle to find any better, it's a one of a kind movie, that doesn't cease to impress."
A Must See Film,helenekim,2 December 2009,9,"I knew nothing about this film before I actually saw it. Considering it was one of the first foreign films I had ever seen I was shocked that I enjoyed it that much. The acting is brilliant, the story is delightful and very understandable. Everything has been put together and made a compelling finish. The camera work helps the film to be so gratifying especially for someone who does not understand the language the film is made in. Every angle tells a different story so you never draw your eyes away for a split second as the film captivates you that much you do not want to a miss a single shot. The director has admirably captured the idea of the poverty, crime, drugs and violence and throughout that you follow Rocket (the one ounce of hope of escapism from the favelas). Considering I had never really enjoyed a foreign film before I would say this was a great one to see and I found it very satisfying and would definitely watch it again."
Half decent yarn for sure,quasimodo-26512,29 April 2019,8,Just finished watching this movie and I must say I enjoyed it . It wasn't dragged out or boring and the story is somewhat believable!!
On patriotism and violent crime,jghbrown,16 March 2008,3,What is it about violent crime that makes everyone so damn proud of it? From the brainless antics of Al Capone to the drugged stupidity of Scarface (and many others since  I didn't finish Reservoir Dogs cos it ended up in pieces in my garbage can) there seem to be no lengths to which directors won't go to display the trashier side of life and yet make it seem like they're showing cuddly everyday folks.
Degraded perspective about degradation in a polished videoclip packaging,Mashi69,5 April 2006,4,"My opinion on this movie has rapidly degraded as hours and days passed by. I too, as the movie progressed, got involved in the neat technical package, and violence in itself was not so disturbing... you know, we are civilized 21st century men! we love violence (when we are not directly involved with it), plus we love violent movies and this one, well,was just a punch to the stomach a bit harder than the previous ones. And then the story, ooh, it was so wisely penned! with that delicious ironic look à-la Tarantino to smooth the edges of the bullet holes."
SHOCKING,SinaAwdijan,9 May 2021,10,"What we would call fictional is real life for so many kids in Brazil, even now... a movie so shocking and so important for the world to know."
City of God... Why didn't I watch this thing sooner?,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,11 December 2016,10,"City of God has been considered by many critics and viewers to be one of the absolute best movies to come from the 2000s; now I see and completely understand why people love this film, and why it's a time capsule that is still relevant and important for today's world; at least for Brazil."
Outstanding,emmatiktokwolf,10 February 2022,7,"Great movie still holds up well today. Cinematography top notch, acting amazing from whole cast, directing on point, casting fantastic. Couldn't ask for anything better."
Tough movie,wwillems,6 February 2006,8,"Very tough movie portraying the lives of kids/teenagers in one of Rio's favelas. What I liked most about the movie is the way in which it is told, through the eyes of one of the kids who manages to escape the harsh reality of the favela. I also like the flashback following the opening scene in which a group of kids tries to catch an escaped rooster. The freeze-frame shots are very nice as well. It is a very fast paced movie and sometimes it is hard to keep track of all that is happening especially because the movie covers a couple of decades. I saw this movie after visiting Rocinha in Rio the week before. I did not realize until after having seen the movie that Seu Jorge plays the role of Mane Galinha. He makes beautiful music these days and one of his quotes is really frightening ""The other actors were ... curious. They wanted to know if the favelas are really like that. I said unfortunately they're much worse."""
DVD has even better doc!,KlutzyGirl,21 November 2009,10,"As riveting as the film is, the documentary on the DVD reveals a world that is even sadder and crueler. We get the history behind the madness and why nothing will ever change. There is so much evil in the world it boggles the mind sometimes. I'm so privileged to be able to turn this off and go back to my safe little life. I know I'd never survive in the horrible environments some people must live in."
Surprisingly good storyline.,otatom,15 April 2005,8,"Being a fan of gangsta movies anyway, i thought that i would find this film enjoyable, expecting typical conventions like Blood and Gore, conflicting gangs, Crime, and a slick super-stylish main character. However this film actually follows a true story, and the main character, telling the story and managing to see all the different perspectives, a photographer. The movies has several story lines linking together explaining how it ended in the way it did. The movie follows a non-linear storyline going backwards and forwards in time, Rocket's life from being a child to his age in the story is explained in some detail. This movie is more than a gangsta movie, it is the story of someone's life in the slums and the lengths that people went to to get money. A must see,although it is in subtitles you quickly get used to reading them and stop even noticing."
It's probably well made but that's little comfort.,GiraffeDoor,22 March 2019,4,I want to like this movie but it just takes itself a bit too seriously.
original,isaacch-99917,30 June 2016,10,"City of god is a different film. Its one of a kind. There aren't many films like it. There is a fair bit of criticism standing against this movie. Such as it being too violent, not appealing to everyone or it being in Portuguese, therefore being subtitled. Without these factors 'City of god' is an almost perfect movie. I don't mind those factors. I don't mind it being violent or being in Portuguese , just that some people do."
Pristine excellence,KnightsofNi11,8 August 2012,8,"Violence and brutality abound in this passionate story of a city and its crime wave. City of God tells the story of this city, the City of God, which sits just a few miles away from Rio de Janero, but it's no paradise. It's a dangerous and crime ridden world where gangs run the streets and guns and drugs are the things which give a man power and control over everyone else. We learn the story of this city from the eyes of Rocket, a quiet young man with hopes of being a journalist one day, assuming he can survive that long in such dangerous conditions. Through crafty editing, engrossing cinematography, and a plethora of disturbingly real performances we witness a most unsettling yet uniquely fascinating story unfold in City of God."
"Entertaining, nothing more",Robby_V,13 September 2005,4,I just watched this one and I just sat there watching 130 minutes of kids playing Indian vs. Cowboy with real guns. I did not get a single thread of emotional bonding with the characters or any of the events. This belittles all of what happens in the movie and even manages to reduce the most dramatic scene of the movie(initiation of a new member into the gang) to nothing more then one more kid shooting a gun.
Solid little crime flick,Horst_In_Translation,25 December 2015,6,"""Cidade de Deus"" is a Brazilian movie that is set in the slums of the same country. We follow two brothers over the years and their lives develop completely differently. It is a world of crime, drugs, desperation, but also a world of hope for a better future. We find out about their involvement with gangs, with girls and also about their hobbies in general. One big hobby of one of them is photography and it may shape the path to the better future I just mentioned. The film runs for over 2 hours and was directed by Fernando Meirelles and Kátia Lund. Bráulio Mantovani adapted Paulo Lins' novel and the result may be Brazil's most famous film of all time."
"City of god is a foreign depiction of what is going on, One of my favorites!",PersianPlaya408,8 August 2005,10,"this ghetto tale of two boys growing up in a suburb of rio de janeiro is a perfect film. The acting is 100% natural and looks as if these kids actually did grow up in that neighborhood (maybe they did, some directors like to use local regular people). The script was brilliantly written, it was a very entertaining film. There's not much more I can say other than that the director did a great, job, this film was always interesting, and the actors were great, the characters were very well written and this film blows many of the gangster type movies based in America out of the picture. 10/10 #45 on my list of all time favorite films."
Stunning gangster movie,Spinal-Column,30 January 2003,7,"If I had written this review as soon as I came out of the cinema I think I would have given it 9/10. However, having had a week or so to reflect on the movie I don't think I will be quite so generous."
"disturbing, shocking, sick",eustfam,28 May 2005,1,"I can't seem to find the words to describe this very disturbing film. I cannot imagine such a life...reminiscent of ""The Lord of the Flies."" Kids aren't kids--they shoot, they kill, they have no consciences. It is like peering into the eyes of soul-less little people."
Masterpiece,lukemickelsonflight,7 October 2019,10,"City of God directed by Fernando Meirelles and co director Katia Lund has a very deceitful title for a film that takes us down a path of heartache and carnage. What amazes me most about the film is the astounding character development that takes place throughout the plot. Perhaps the best example of this is following Lil Ze and his storyline. Originating with his childhood Lil Ze quickly develops into apathetic killer at the tragic age of ten, when he guns down room of people with a wicked laugh. As he ages it becomes clear that he is an individual who cannot function in society. A great display of his inability to function as an individual is found during the scene of Benny's going away party. Lil Ze is furious with Benny's decision to leave and resents the girlfriend because this was the only person Lil Ze was ever able to connect with. While attending the party Lil Ze is seen as awkward and inept in social situations furthering his anger. With the murder of Benny Lil Ze comes full bloom into the monster that he is and continues on to commit a myriad of heinous acts. Through the use of nonlinear storytelling Meirelles does a phenomenal job of depicting each of his characters and their growth and adaption. I also think the choice to use nonprofessional actors helps cement the realism of each of these characters. Again in the case of Lil Ze, the actor actually endured an upbringing in the City of God and was able to deliver it on screen. In addition to the acting and character development the cinematography is what cements this movie as a 10/10 for me. The vibrant use of colors combined with the effortless flow of camera work illustrates what a master Cesar Charlone. This movie and its combination of acting, mise en scene, editing, sound track and the powerful message it sends warrant the perfect score, all the awards received and cement it a place in film history."
Authentic and stunning,martinpersson97,8 September 2021,10,"This movie, by an acclaimed director and with several Oscars, deserves all the praise it gets."
Movie Review Profits,rachelrose-87356,9 August 2019,8,Play Cidade de Deus! It is fast and easy to view! A good way to spend your time. Be the best!
MUST SEE,justineszaflarski,7 October 2019,9,"One sentence to describe this movie best, in my opinion, is difficult to watch, but extremely hard to look away from. City of God is full of chaos, violence, and killing but has a good underlying story of a kid who pushed through his childhood and became a photographer. Anyone who watches this should recognize their privilege. This movie not only makes you think, but make you change your perspective on the world and your part in it. The writer and director take this disturbing content and change it into something intriguing. The performance, the direction, the cinematography, the music, all laced together to create a wonderful film documenting the painful truth of living in a Brazilian slum. Everyone should give this film a chance, you won't regret it."
"Good, not great.",jzathajenious,1 November 2005,8,"Well I've finally seen the much hyped City of God, and while it is not a masterpiece, it is an exciting and well directed film."
Horny on main,TheCorniestLemur,13 June 2022,8,"Bit of a nostalgia trip here, this was the first film I ever watched in an academic context, when I was 16. It's been five years."
Hell on Earth,Ali_John_Catterall,19 November 2009,10,"It's a measure of how untouchable Quentin Tarantino was once considered that City Of God director Walter Salles was compared favourably to him on the film's original release: pre-Slumdog, world cinema wasn't usually associated with breathless, hyper-kinetic camera-work."
Masterpiece,saoconrado40,8 November 2009,10,"City of God is a Masterpiece. With all the rubbish that is coming out of Hollywood these days, this Brazilian movie shows that plot and substance will smash CGI special effects any day of the week. Not for the weak of heart, COG is shocking, confronting, and also fascinating. It depicts real life in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro, where the horror of drug warfare is juxtaposed with spectacular scenery and beauty. Unlike the privileged few, the favelados are trapped in a vicious cycle of poverty and violence, which is almost impossible to escape from. Hollywood could learn more than a thing or two from this movie, it far surpasses any other action movie of the past decade. Simply a must see. 10 out of 10"
A great movie with well-written characters and powerful scenes of violence,brianberta,15 August 2015,8,"City of God is a very violent, moving, and heartbreaking movie about gangs in the slums of Rio De Janeiro."
Always will be in my top movies to watch,anneth-98033,15 July 2020,9,"As a person that comes from Latin America, I have to say this is as real as you can get it!"
Citt of God is Fabulous,Kshalene,8 April 2005,10,"Easily one of the best movies of the year, perhaps the decade. I have not seen a gangster movie with the level of nuance and attitude as City of God. All the of the characters are wonderfully developed and all have their own identity to add to the message of the film. The locations in which the film was shot are almost a character unto themselves and I left wanting to see more of this slum of Rio de Janiero. There is nothing that I can say about this movie other than it is a masterpiece of storytelling and setting... This is the movie that will put Latin American cinema back to it levels of a couple of years ago. Yet City of God moves beyond what Perros Del Amor and Y Tu Mama Tambien ever dreamed of achieving. Go watch this movie!"
One of the best crime movies,shekhoosraja,3 April 2008,10,"Inspired by true events, this is one of the best crime movies that I have come across. The beauty of it is in the impeccable subtlety with which shocking series of events are presented. They seem totally digestible."
it is not easy to break away from violence in hell,hderksen,13 August 2007,10,"In the slums of Rio de Janeiro, where the police is either corrupt or absent, the cycle of violence seems without end. Children witness and participate in drugs and crime at an early age. Here it may be harder than anywhere else to choose good over evil, to break away from the violence. The story is told through the eyes, and lens, of Rocket. Through him we see Li'l Ze rise to power, the showdown with the rival gang led by Carrot and Knockout Ned and his demise. This movie has great characters, superbly acted."
"Powerful, this movie represents harsh realities.",filipemanuelneto,9 February 2017,7,"Normally Brazilian cinema is strong in good comedy but rather unhappy with respect to dramatic films. However, this film is quite different. Most of the action takes place in one of the largest and most dangerous areas of Rio de Janeiro, the so-called ""favela"" Cidade de Deus (favela is the name that Brazilians give to the slums, where the poorest live, in the midst of total misery). There, people live alongside with crime, knowing that it may be the last day of their lives and having few opportunities to rise in life. In fact, this is not a movie thing, this is reality. The film merely uses reality to stage a story in which two young people take different life paths: one ends up becoming a photographer and the other becomes a drug dealer. These stories are fiction but they are very similar to the lives of immense young people who live in that place. And that's the great advantage of this deeply shocking movie: we know it's all fiction but it could be true."
Goodfellas of Brazil!,tankace,30 June 2016,9,"City of God is by far the best film about the underdeveloped areas of Brazil and the fact many of the actors, producers and crew were from the district of the same name gives to the flick much more faithfulness to its source. In summary go watch for it is amazing, brutally honest and it doesn't fear to be funny, make the characters likable and to show the more day to day problems of life, like as the narrator say"" find a girl""."
Best True Story I've Ever Seen,toxiccity,19 February 2005,9,"Although it is based on a true story a lot of the elements are truthful. This amazing film gives you an insight into the slums of Rio De Jineiro. This was my first movie I have seen with subtitles all the way through, however after 5 minutes I forgot about it as I was lost in the power of the movie. Although the film is graphic in many ways the movie has a comical side to it that adds another dimension to the picture. The film has an excellent storyline with great acting and intense power. This is a must see for anybody but if you like powerful films such as Godfather and Fight Club this is just your sort of film. It is just another example of the fact you can make an astonishing film with a low budget and unproven actors."
Another Side Of Brazil,imim123,12 October 2015,9,"Among countless merits it enjoys, this is a most conspicuous one: It shows a strong sense of reality. Since it is based on a true story, it demonstrates another side of Brazil, one which consists of chaos, crime and death. Despite several objective reasons on how ""City of God"" come into existence, people's ignorance is the main cause. By this I mean, Neither rich people nor the government want to have anything to do with ""City Of God"", thus their deliberate ignorance of poor people should be held responsible for all the misfortune that happened. In this deserted city, poverty breeds crime and crime leads to more poverty. As a consequence, it is hard for people to leave the city and even if they do, they always get dragged back.As we can see, the only way to break this wretched cycle is education. Fair and quality education will enable kids of the next generation to have more options other than become another gang member."
astonishing,ahalbatli,7 October 2019,9,"City of God is a masterpiece that the international cinema ever made. I consider it to be the best international movie I have seen so far. This film is a story about the violent life of the favelas in Brazil. City of God may contain the most violent content I have ever seen in a movie, to reflect the original true story. The experience the movie offering is really hard to watch. However, it holds you and you would get more attached more to the story. In the middle of the chaos and violence in City of God the film is about how a young peaceful kid wants to achieve his dream and make something out of his hard life. Also, how young kids can transform to be criminals because of poverty in the town.
The cinematography, music, and the timeline are astonishing, especially, the vibrant colors, which gave the film some life aspects besides the violent and the killing in the movie. The characters are all well developed, but the only thing holding me from giving it 10/10 is the lack of emotion and sadness from the characters in the movie. It could be because of how the Brazilian cinema works but it was the main different than American movies."
Extraordinarily Tragic,Popsicle_A,17 June 2003,10,"The film City of God depicts a world where many children do not live to reach adulthood.  In a city run by drugs, gangs and of lost innocence we see a variety of characters and their stories narrated by a young boy who wants to be a photographer."
Technically brilliant though brutal and Shocking,AnandBlaster,3 February 2023,9,"The movie pulls you in within a few minutes thanks to the realistic writing, locations and a fantastic cinematography. The runtime which is around 2 hours flies just like that. So many sequences, for instance the story of the apartment, stay in the mind mainly because of the cinematography and a unique style of editing. Some of the scenes are violent and disturbing to watch, especially when there are kids involved. Even more difficult to fathom is when the end credits rolled as based on a true story."
Oh my God! This movie was amazing!,meeza,27 February 2004,10,"`City of God' is a Brazilian cinematic masterpiece.  Thank God that it has been nominated for 4 academy awards. Director Fernando Meirelles mesmerizing look at teenage ganglords in a Brazilian slum-town nicknamed the City of God is one of the best crime films of all time. Hey! I know this might be an overstatement so please do not gang up on me. The film is narrated by the reticent teenager named Rocket who lives in the `city of god' but is not a hoodlum himself. However, he is surrounded by a life of crime & violence that commands this ghetto. The teenage ganglords control the city of god and there is minimal police intervention. Hey, why not start a Youth Crime Watch program? I had to shoot that one in there (shameless promotion). Alexandre Rodrigue as Rocket sparks up an astronomical performance. However, the most puissant performance of the film is delivered by Leandro Firmino as the menacing youth gang-leader Lil'Ze. His killing-spree ruthless demeanor makes him the most intimidating character I have seen in film this year. Among the aforementioned, other godlike attributes in the `City of God' is the amplitude that Meirelles inserts in its screenplay & narrative.  The film is based on accounts of a true story and Meirelles & Screnwriter Paulo Lins are most credible in keeping it Rio, I mean real. `City of God' is magisterial but yet disturbing. Nevertheless, it should be blessed as one of the best foreign films in history. ***** Excellent"
"Great acting, story, and cinematography.",nicolechan916,1 November 2015,8,"Based on a true favela (slum) named 'City of God' in Rio, the film does a great job at creating a realistic looking depiction of the life there. A little trivia: The location in which they filmed at was a neighbouring favela, as the actual favela was too dangerous to film in. Another trivia: Filmmakers actually recruited children from the favela to produce an authentic feel for the movie. Based on this fact, it is deeply disconcerting that these children are able to act out violet scenes so well, as if they already possessed the persona of their characters. The acting overall is very realistic, and the whole cast does a fantastic job, probably because they have been exposed to this reality all their life."
Violence is not enough,avito,10 July 2007,4,The world is full of unpleasant things.
So much sin in the city of god..,oriyon8,25 March 2006,9,"Best foreign film i've ever seen including ""Y tu mama tambien"" & ""Crouching tiger hidden dragon"". Though set in the slums of Brazil, the ideal of lost youth and dead-end circumstances are experiences world round. But this film also revels in it's depiction of Brazil as a universe. A place most of us see as serenely beautiful, but underneath it's post card image lies all these dangers."
City of God -- One of 2002's greatest films,jonathanruano,27 September 2014,10,"""City of God"" is a masterful film about the criminal world of one of Brazil's most notorious slums. ""City of God,"" as the name suggests, was sold as a paradise to Brazilians whose former homes had been destroyed by floods and acts of arson. But this slum turned out to be a purgatory on earth and eventually became a burning inferno filled with violence and grinding poverty. This slum also served as a microcosm for a cynical policy of moving the poor and their problems away from the more prosperous urban areas and then forgetting about them -- unless, that is, the level of crime and violence really got out of hand."
Not worth the hype,frjenny92,21 November 2009,1,"Nowadays some consider a movie to be phenomenal as long as it shows tragical poverty and violence. It is so distinct from their lives that they unconsciously feel ""educated"" by seeing the film; praising the film therefore becomes a way of self-elevation."
Truly Remarkable Cinema,appleskimorange-756-841050,4 June 2010,9,"This is what fine cinema is all about: motivational, probing and ultimately thought-provoking. This film scrutinizes the gang lifestyle in the Rio suburb of the film's namesake, City Of God, and along the way, captures the audience with its strong performances. This is one of the most influential and beautiful pieces of film-making one will ever see. This is a film that stays with you long after viewing it. Truly a benchmark in modern cinema, proving that the cinema of today still has hope. One of the greatest films, if not the best, of the '00s. If you only watch one foreign film in your lifetime, make this it. 9 out of 10."
amazing!,hazpafis,13 June 2004,10,"What an amazing movie! Everything just seems to fall into place, the directing, the story, the editing, the cinematography. At first, I was a bit peeved at all the shots but realized it was a movie of parallelism. All those dark shots reflected what life was in Brazil for these boys, how dark it is for them, like there was no way out and that other people did not see them or refused to make an effort to see them and their situation."
Excellent,lambiepie-2,23 December 2004,10,"Here is another great entry into the world of cinema - a film that contains a compelling story, compelling actors, great camera work and it makes you think and speak of it long after you've viewed it."
"Cheap and disgusting, trying to pass for art",Jim West,14 February 2004,1,"In spite of so much undeserved acclaim from some critics, this is a terrible movie, cheap in all respects as far as the cinematic art is concerned. Many people may approve it merely on account of its demagogic handling of a 'relevant issue' such as extreme poverty and criminality in the slums area of underdeveloped countries. But regardless of its dynamic editing that attempts to pass for 'modern' or 'innovative', this is an extremely bad movie, poorly written, directed and enacted.  I'll never understand why the AMPAS absurdly decided to nominate this nauseating movie for several awards. But don't fall for this imposture: trust me, this picture is not worth the price of your admission ticket.  Stay away from it!"
...,JaydoDre,15 July 2016,9,"In City of God, the brilliance in movie making is rivaled only by the brutality."
Cruel and Gripping,Matt_Brammer,26 May 2022,10,"City of God is one of those movies that has been on my watchlist for years now. I would always see pictures of it and reviews of people praising it, but up until the past year or so I had no real drive to watch foreign films. Thankfully, I finally got around to watching it because this movie is extremely impressive in many ways. Almost too impressive. There are few films that are difficult for me to watch, but there are several points during this movie where I felt like I was seeing something illegal. Nothing in the movie seems like it's fake or acted out. In the best way possible the film feels like a documentary. The cherry on top, is that at the end they tell you it's based on true events which makes all of the brutal events of the movie so much worse. I can't even imagine all of the effort that all of the staff and actors put into this movie. Touching on the acting, it's superb all around. I think the child actors are some of the best I have ever seen and their older versions are just as good. The cinematography/directing is very creative and almost like a Tarantino movie in some ways. Anyone who is even halfway interested in checking out this movie, definitely give it a shot because you may never see another movie like it again."
"I smoke, I snort. I've killed and robbed. I'm a man.",Artimidor,24 December 2012,10,"Films about violence there are aplenty. Many of them are purely fictional and are glamorized bloodbaths made for special audiences. Necessary are only a few. For your consideration: Brazilian filmmaker Fernando Meirelles' ""Cidade de Deus"" dealing with the eponymous ""City of God"". Initially the name of a housing project created by the Brazilian government in the 1960s, the result was abandoned by the authorities after its creation and turned out to be anything but what its name suggests. Taken over by drug lords crime is the way to get by in these favelas. Killings are everyday business, and they happen on the side of the police, on the side of the drug dealers, or among the people in the slums themselves by exchanging their arguments with weapons. Since its creation, children growing up in these areas have learned to be part of the violence - they are on the receiving end and they practice it without questioning. They live to survive."
Film about scary childhood,ineffableee,8 December 2020,7,"One of the most memorable films about life in the favelas. Captivating plot, cool shooting. A film where you have to make an important choice in your life and showing how important it is to go towards your dream"
Poverty is a justification for murder,aboutin59,29 April 2005,2,"This story (if any) describe a band of thugs who find any excuse to murder. The writer exploit the myth that if you live in poverty, you turn as a delinquent Which implies that if you have a luxury car in front of your door in your childhood with no scratch, you will turn up a lawyer of a doctor."
Documental of life,diemartini,3 March 2005,8,"This film is really good. In spite of that I believe that but the attractive thing that it has is the terrible reality of the people who live in fabela. The terror that inspires a place to us like that. It is very difficult to escape to that terror and that feeling is the one that dominates the film throughout. It gives fear us, scares the reality to us, because we, as much as you readers we lived in a bubble, in a privileged world, where we have everything , or at least all our basic necessities within reach of our hands. Then we see films like these, that they show another reality to us and we were scared, and we are thankful to have the sufficient thing to live and to be able to give our pleasures us. This film is documentary an extraordinary one on the misery of the world, misery that we deal ed with not watching to be able to live peacefully."
"City of God, You Have Stolen My Soul!",gavin6942,11 September 2005,8,"This very long movie is entirely in Portuguese (what I call the devil's language). Yet, you quickly get sucked in and no longer notice you're reading subtitles. The story is more or less that of 2 boys in the hood, one who wants to be a photographer. The other follows a very Scarface-esquire path to rise to the peak of gangsterdom. Oddly, while neither one helps the other on purpose, neither could achieve what they did without the other."
Raw & astoundingly real,ketkarparth,26 August 2021,9,"One of the best foreign dramas I have ever seen. The film just keeps on esclatating till the very end. The actors are raw and rugged, some of the sequences just make you flinch. Hats off to the creators, they surely have the guts to bring such a subject in front of the audience which was still in love with censored love stories for a long time. Great job!"
"City of God is Not a Movie, City of God is a Living, Breathing World.",davidcassels,18 April 2016,10,"A while ago now, someone was professing to me how well done ""The Lord of the Rings"" is. They said to me, ""You know, JRR Tolkien didn't just write a book, he created a world."" Although I agreed with him that that was true I retorted that the Peter Jackson films failed to create a living breathing world similar to that seen in the books. My friend agreed but said that I shouldn't hold that against the movies because it is impossible to make a celluloid, living breathing world. At the time I begrudgingly agreed to his statement."
A gut-wrenching look at Brazilian street crime,Kubris,28 July 2011,9,"City of God shows the evolution (and de-evolution) of Brazilian favelas from the sixties to the eighties. It follows Rocket's turbulent life, and Ze's descent, as well as showing a few other characters and places stories."
One of the best films ever made...may change your life,clarke-21,27 December 2008,10,"This has to be one of the best movies I've ever seen. Fernando Meirelles gets credit for bringing this amazing story to life, after reading the novel written by Paulo Lins."

The man with the camera,p_radulescu,11 March 2005,,"City of God, a ""favela"" in Rio."
Stunning,kasperbaggerman,6 January 2015,9,"One of my favorite movies. I can be very short about this film. Never has a movie evoked so many emotions in such a short period of time from me. From raw excitement during some scenes to sadness in others. The story is very well presented, with realistic characters. The good guys aren't 100% good, nor are the bad guys 100% bad. For me, every character had at least one thing I could relate to, even Zedje. Some may consider the film to be too violent, but I think the violence is needed to realistically portrait the hard life in the City of God, or any other slum where drug cartels are present. A well shot and edited film, with uplifting music, an evoking story an ensemble of characters, uplifting music. What more could one wish for in a movie?"
A modern classic,agnesoshinyemi,8 April 2005,10,"At first,I was forced to watch this movie and now,I don't regret it.This movie is something else entirely, but in a good way,a very good way.The movie was made in such a realistic way that for sure,you'll know it's a true story.It's one of those movies that contains all the elements,from comedy(the ending with The Runts) to romance to tragedy,in fact,it's a *must watch* movie.The actors,even with little experience,did their jobs incredibly well.I think this movie deserved the nominations it got but I think it would have deserved the Oscar for best original score.It's a movie that words can't even describe how good it is.I do hope that the actors will get wider recognition and job opportunities in the future and I also hope the same for the crew and everybody who was associated with the making of this movie.In other words it's a true modern classic."
A Modern Masterpiece,jcphoenix,5 March 2007,10,"Picture this: You are slowly walking towards a boy no more than 10 years of age  someone you have played soccer games with and joked around with. The boy reaches down with his hand, brings a gun back up, and pumps you full of bullets. In the multiple Academy Award nominee City of God, not only does this happen, but it does not even come as a surprise. This Brazilian epic takes the iconic movies of the '90s and creates an intense blend that utilizes the fractured structure from Pulp Fiction, the hard-hitting style of Requiem for a Dream, and the ambitious storytelling of Goodfellas. The oddity here is not that director Fernando Meirelles mixes parts from these films together, but rather that in doing so, he has created a modern masterpiece that will surely be remembered as one of the defining films for the millennium decade. Taking place during the 1960s and into the 1970s, City of God is set in the Brazilian city of the same name. Located close to Rio de Janeiro, the two places could not be more different. Rio de Janeiro, virtually a tropical paradise, contrasts starkly with the seedy slums of the City of God. The structure of the film is almost like a tangled skein  following a loosely chronological order, the movie often doubles back on itself to retell a story from a different perspective and it often takes detours to tell stories of the varied and fascinating individuals in the city. The result is a sprawling tour-de-force with a massive cast of characters  some who triumph over their enemies but more who fail. The film makes use of one of its many characters as the narrator, Rocket (Alexandre Rodrigues), but he is not so much the protagonist as he is a center for all the stories to meet. As an aspiring photographer that is always on the sidelines, he is the perfect character to take the audience on the journey through the decades. In fact, the main character of City of God is arguably not a person but rather the city itself, portrayed as cruel, relentless, and endlessly bloodthirsty. The closest thing the film has to a main character is Li'l Zé, the brutal and power-hungry man who quickly rises through the ranks (generally by shooting down the competition) to become the czar of the drug underworld. Brilliantly portrayed with wild abandon by Leandro Firmino, Li'l Zé's unpredictable and chaotic nature is counterbalanced by his closest friend, Benny (Phellipe Haagensen), who is like the yang to Li'l Zé's ying. Less temperamental and more relaxed, Benny is considered the coolest gangster alive by residents of the city and can save the lives of many people with a word to Li'l Zé. Stylistically, the film exhausts just about every film-making trick one can think of on the spot: split-screen (used sparsely but effectively); 360-degree camera turns; slam cuts; slow-motion shots  all of these and many more are present in the film. In one instance, the absence of sound during a key scene helps to heighten the impact. In another, a flashing strobe light enhances the haunting quality and atmosphere of the empty nightclub to a startlingly memorable result. City of God is most successful however not because of its stylistic choices, or its many interesting characters, or its score (which is also impressive). All of these contribute to the making of a great film, but what elevates City of God to the level of artistry that only a handful of films such as Schindler's List and The Shawshank Redemption achieve is its uncompromising screenplay. Not only is the structure brilliantly conceived and not only are the characters extraordinary well developed, but the screenplay is also able to bring in a sense of the never-ending and continuous cycles of war without ever trying to moralize. Simply put, the film is a window into a world, not a path, and it simply views rather than changes. In this way, what the audience sees in that small window shakes them to the core without any feelings of manipulation whatsoever. In a film in which despair and brutality are so common, the irony of the title is not lost. City of God is a masterpiece in every sense of the word  a stunning and merciless film that portrays the era, the people, and the sense of hopelessness honestly and without compromise. I would not have it any other way."
This is it. The Top. Cannot Get Better. Nothing Surpasses,fchriskoch,15 December 2011,10,This is my first time reviewing a film in IMDb or any site. This seemed liked the perfect title for me to start with. The reason is because no other film has ever effected me like City Of God.
Fabuloso!,themarina1,3 August 2004,9,"This is a brilliant story of 2 friends. The movie follows Buscape and Ze (played by Alexandre Rodrigues and Leandro Firmino), two youths that live in a favela outside of Rio de Janeiro. Although both boys grow up in the same place and under pretty much the same circumstances, Buscape become a photographer while Ze becomes the local drug lord, pretty much running the city. The story follows both boys through their lives from early 60's and into the 70's."
City of God - looks like it was made by Him Himself.,sausagefactory2010,30 May 2007,10,"Many people say this is a fantastic film for its striking visual achievements, however I personally feel that they alone would never carry a film, especially a film as epic and grand as this. Of course, every time you see Lil' Ze's rampages or Rocket caught in the middle of the shootout in the streets (literally) it startles you with its sense of grandeur and bravado, but really the achievement is carrying such a brilliant story, where the hero does not actually do much but look on and try to survive. Fernando Meirelles pushes the boat out and, in fact, you get surprised in your own personal emotional involvement with the story. Just for example, the scene where a young boy has to choose between being shot in the hand or the foot is particularly poignant."
I felt crying,luoqimapes,27 May 2020,9,"After watching the movie, I felt like crying for a minute. I have to say that a lot of the art was well handled and I could feel the director's thoughts and feelings."
Mind Blowing,puneet2004,5 March 2007,10,"When i was recommended this movie, i didn't know that i was about to witness a masterpiece. Every scene fit in the puzzle, every mystery unraveled as the movie progressed. And i could not find any incoherence, such was the perfection of the director. The portrayal of Lil Dice was chilling to say the least. The fact that a child at such a young age chose a life of crime and enjoyed murders the most was something that reminded me of The Interpreter and sent a shiver down my spine. Especially the scene where he kills the people in the motel and laughs off after that. The deep rooted corruption increases my disgust for all such acts. And despite the fact that i would like the conditions in the City of God to become better, the final scene made me sad that everything would be repeated again. And that gives me little hope. Nevertheless, everything in this movie deserved a 10/10 and i doubt if a movie of the same genre can be made better than this."
Easily One of the Best Films of All-Time,joshuafagan-64214,30 August 2016,10,They would never make this film in America.
"Visceral, uncomfortable and real.",Hikalgo,24 February 2023,10,"I had heard a lot about this movie but recently I decided to see it and it was definitely a unique experience. It's a very uncomfortable film, not only because of its context, which is really sad, but because of the camera shots, which are combinations of the traditional ones and that the camera doesn't also focus on seeing sequence shots. In situations that do not warrant it, like the taxi driver in São Paulo or the death of Bené, it is rare but it is also a genius that this film does perfectly, that is why it is a 10/10 for me, a work that you must see if you want to be stressed and uncomfortable. :)"
One of the most realistic & powerful movies ever!,Dimi1822,23 April 2005,,"Coming from being a huge fan of the Lord of the Rings series because of its epic and powerful impact, I watched City of God that was set in a closer to modern time and a poverty-stricken location. Even knowing that, the realism and powerful impact that City of God had upon me was at the same epic level as Lord of the Rings. The acting was not the best I have ever seen, although it still was excellent and didn't hurt the movie at all. The emotions that it brought out and the realism that I felt while watching every moment of it was incomparable to any other movie I have watched. It really brought me fully into the action and to the story, and I felt like I was truly experiencing it. It drew me in fully through the end with its Tarantino style story-telling and captivating recollections through the eyes of Rocket the photographer. In all honesty, I almost can't believe it was a movie. It was so realistic and so well done, that it felt like a documentary capturing the true occurrences of every scary and powerful moment of this story. It was that realistic and that powerful, that I couldn't believe behind each scene there was a director coordinating every moment; as it all just flowed so smoothly together from start to finish. Every scene was perfectly detailed and constructed and the director's brilliance emanated from the screen during every minute that passed by. All in all a brilliant creation worthy of the recognition and appreciation it has received from those who have been privileged enough to see and enjoy what is City of God."
Puts Boyz N' The Hood to shame,JPL-916,15 March 2004,,"For those who haven't seen it, It's a story of a freelance photographer who appears to get caught in a street gang clash by accident. But it's no accident. He traces the whole history of the gangs and how he grew up and how the gang members grew into their stature."
Overrated so so much,manco-25800,7 May 2017,1,"I CAN NOT believe this movie is so highly rated! This movie is misleading in so many ways, starting with the title ""City of God"", how pathetic. City of the Legions of Hell would have been much more accurate. An awful, awful movie. Like one of the viewers said, it is cheap in all aspects. To those people who haven't seen this film, please stay away from this junk at all cost. Go Watch some wholesome, soul-lifting contemporary Russian art movies like the Return and then see how cheap this movie is. But this is totally a piece of stinking garbage. Violence need not to be portrayed in such an outlandish, vulgar style. The camera movement almost made me throw up. Editing is almost not- existent. A cheap, cheap movie that to the greatest irony won so many undeserving awards. People who raved about this film are idiots. Critics too. It is just pathetic. Even Hollywood movies are one hundred times better as much as I don't like them."
A ravaging and compelling insight into Rio's mean streets,Cineman187,19 February 2005,10,"Fernando Meirelles has orchestrated a fascinating piece of movie making to establish not only himself as a fine director, but also to establish a film that surely deserves its place among the best of its kind. The story and characters seem to revel in the distinct Brazilian surroundings and every character relishes their roles; Leandro Firmino flourishes as Li'l Zé, as he shows a menacing and devilish streak to his psychotic character. Alexandre Rodrigues (Rocket) tells the story how it is and before we know it the sun is scorching down on us while gunfights of gang warfare smother the streets in broad daylight. Violence is present only when necessary, and when it surfaces it is quite extreme. Don't let this deter you from viewing this flawless film - even if you happen to feel uncomfortable at the sight of blood - because the film has quality in abundance; the camera work vividly captures the intensity of the script, and the raw dialect of Portuguese adds an extra punch (if you speak the language). The story revolves around a young man whom dreams of becoming a photographer. His struggle to contend with everyday violence - which seems to be a recurring theme throughout the film - sets up a tense and intriguing atmosphere. We are brought to the streets so we have an idea of how the drug situation works and what it takes for gangs to protect their business. With a beautiful view of a landscape,sadly bearing the vast and derelict Favalas, we are intentionally made to explore just how poverty stricken these people are. This film defines just about every emotion possible and with fluid skill. I don't need to recommend this film as you have probably seen it advertised everywhere, but I will say don't avoid it because you would certainly be missing out."
Great movie,swiss731,26 October 2018,9,"This movie was intense. It keeps you on the edge of your seat, waiting to see what's going to happen next. I wouldn't recommend letting your children watch it, but for mature adults - it's a very entertaining flick."
Genius work!,ordePNicola,13 August 2015,9,"Probably the best movie that the Portuguese language has ever seen. The way that Fernando Meirelles used to capture and describe the harsh reality of Brazilian slums and, via a special embodiment , was able to transpire the difficulty that young people have to disconnect from the criminal environment surrounding them and all the corruption and urban warfare that exists in Brazil today ."
The 'Godfather' of Brazil,mumossa64,4 May 2010,10,"City of god shows a harsh but true view of the slums of Rio and the reason for this being true is because this film is in fact based on a real life story. It is quite shocking as most would see this as unrealistic drama just to be powerful but every disturbing part happened for real. That is what mostly makes this film unforgettable but it has also a stunning story on what could be considered a gangster/ drama film with twists and turns as it goes on and delivers with a lot of depth. This film is subtitled so you must keep up with dialogue fast but that also was well written and despite the actors being relatively unknown, they all performed really well. A true masterpiece"
A Study in Brutality,gbread7,30 March 2003,,"City of God was a study in brutality.  Offending all of the senses, the movie proceded in using a multisensory approach to capture the very essence of violence, in every sense of the word.  Human beings of every age were tortured and murdered.  A main character was depicted inflicting multiple injuries and deaths while laughing hysterically.  I had to wonder what the point of the movie was.  Any claim to artistic expression evaded me, entirely."
Boring,oarch,6 September 2003,,"Misery, poverty, crime, murder, rape, laziness, drugs, robbery, stupidity.. you name it, it's in this movie. Every single possible form of vice and depravity was there. The very rock bottom of human race is presented with painful accuracy."
You have to be kidding me!,brianbinkle123,3 February 2012,1,"I CAN NOT believe this movie is so highly rated! This movie is misleading in so many ways, starting with the title ""City of God"", how pathetic. City of the Legions of Hell would have been much more accurate."
The Movie Refer To Brilliance Of Cinema,alperensenay,22 March 2022,10,"""Cidade de Deus"" is a different kind of movie in almost every aspect than Hollywood movies. Firstly I want to specify that this was the first movie which I've watched out of Hollywood, it shocked me unexpectedly. As a difference, there are pure good and evil character, on the contrary Hollywood, Although one of them(Lil'Ze) trys to be agreeable and easy-going person, he doesn't achieve it. However, Rocket achieve to be a criminal or a guilty like Lil'Ze. The two main character can not change themself even if they want to. In the movie, Every character behave their nature that they've had since their childhood. Another difference is that there are some scenes that Hollywood doesn't dare to make with full of reality. For instance, the scene between Lil'Ze and robber kids. This scene astonished me deeply, while I was watching I thought probably they would cut the scene short but they didn't. I felt the horror as the kid did. The scene was exterminity for even me."
Outstanding.,jasonoslodgeos,15 March 2021,9,"I was watching sitting down however, this film was outstanding. The film isn't in English which is hard to understand and read subtitles fast however, the casting was brilliant."
Great Cinema Ahead Of Its Time,vishal_khanna,17 February 2005,9,Cidade De Deus is an excellent 'Docudrama' on the lives of the victimised and self victimising street children in the City of God  Rio De Janeiro.
"More like City of Godly acting, directing and sheer brilliance which never wavers for a moment",Jules45,15 March 2010,10,"Ah yes, City of God what a film, what a film. If your not a fan of subtitle films and won't watch any at least make sure this is an exception because you definitely won't regret it."
The Best Foreign and Gangster film I've ever seen,mattburr86,16 October 2005,10,"This is a powerful movie to watch. I've never seen anything like it. It seemingly takes from Goodfellas in terms of narration, Quentin Tarantino style of movie going on how he goes back and forth with some things, and Scarface in terms of brutality but it's a movie all it's own."
"Good, although slightly overrated",basrutten,4 October 2005,8,"""City of God""/""Cidade de Deus"" tells the true (?) story of youth gangs in the titular city, a favela (slum) outside of Rio de Janeiro, in the sixties and seventies."

Roller coaster ride through life in the favilas of Rio and its gang culture,guybishopp,9 June 2008,10,"This is so far the only movie in a foreign language that I have seen, but I understood this film perfectly. City of God is excellent, mesmerising and in a lot of cases sad, sad because the only way these kids are going to make a living is through gangs and violence. However this is the story of a boy who leaves the gang culture and becomes a photographer by leaving the gang culture that killed his older brother. Overrall this a great movie, it captures the audiences attention by showing people in the richer countries (United Kingdom, America) what life is like on the streets of one of the worlds poorer countries (in this case Brazil)."
A Magnificent Movie Experience,roddick-1,4 June 2005,10,I had been trying to watch this for a while and when I finally was able to see it I was blown away!
"""Kill... be respected"".",classicsoncall,18 September 2011,8,"Notwithstanding it's reputation and viewer rating on this board, this is a tough movie to watch. It's not what I'd call an entertaining picture, and it actually takes some work to watch with it's non-linear style and the fact that it's a foreign film with characters having unfamiliar names. I actually needed paper and pen to keep track of the players using street names like Rocket, Shaggy, Li'l Ze and Carrot. But even that all takes a back seat to the sordid nature of life in a ghetto of Rio de Janeiro called Cidade de Deus, the City of God. City of Satan might be more appropriate, as the area where the story takes place is a literal hell on Earth, and life has about as much meaning as the insect you crush beneath your footstep. Most of the picture is visually jarring; watching with my family produced more than a handful of gasps as random street violence was presented as commonplace. The worst to my mind was the decision a pre-teen gang member had to make regarding which of his contemporaries he would have to kill to show loyalty to his leader. I'm just horrified that there are people in the world who actually live this way, with little to no hope of ever escaping to a less turbulent existence. For mere existence it is, with very little chance of escape, except by death which seems the the most viable way out for many of these troubled youth."
Perfect movie about terrible things,martin-straka,3 January 2013,9,"Cidade de Deus is the movie with perfect camera, scriptwriting, editing and acting (a lot of actors were non-professionals but they are really great) but for whole time of watching I wished one and only thing: to see the end titles. This movie forced me to thank the destiny that I was born in calm and prosperous Europe. The other world - that which Cidade de Deus is all about - is like from another galaxy. But unfortunately, it's not."
This movie rocks,randyhndrsn,27 January 2006,10,"City of god is one of the best movies ever, it is so awesome with great violence a very awesome style and very good writing.aia just finished watching it, and it was so cool.It is a movie that you can not get off your mind because of how great it was, it just absolutely rocks so much.I think most people period will love this movie, it is got the violence, the story and great characters.It is a all around classic in my mind and blew me away, i am not a fan of subtitled movies.But i had no trouble reading the subtitles in this movie, i think this movie will only be good subtitled.Not if you can understand it, the reading helped make the movie's style even better to perfection.Just plain cool and very well done, city of god rocks."
A spine chilling film,Gordon-11,26 December 2012,,"This film is about the lives of the people in the City of God, a place full of violence and lawlessness."
My favourite movie of all time!,Rabsi,8 July 2013,10,"For almost 4 years now, Die Hard had been the greatest film I had ever seen. It was top of my list of films, and it always shone as the top film, I never questioned it's position. I still do not question it's position today, simply because it is most definitely the second greatest film I have ever seen. City Of God is sensational, a masterpiece emanating from the slums of Brazil."
One of the greatest movies ever made,tjvinod97,26 August 2015,10,"In my opinion, a good movie is one that tells an important and entertaining story, makes you feel a range of emotions and makes you believe and feel for the events that are happening on screen. It should be able to do this by harmonising acting, writing, directing, post production and sound. And when I think about movies that have been able to exceed these expectations, often City of God is one of the first titles that pops up in my head."
What was purgatory is now Hell,ferguson-6,15 February 2004,8,"Greetings again from the darkness.  Oscar nominated director Fernando Meireilos' film is based on a true story from the slums outside of Rio. This compelling drama literally takes us inside the ultra violent drug world run by the rawest form of machismo.  From an early age, kids are drawn to the power and elite status (so-called respect) that this sick world offers. No one really escapes.  This world is just a giant circle of blood and death where the parts are continously replaced by someone more violent.  Failure comes to those who try to walk away or run away.  This world provides only one way out.  The story is told from the perspective of Rocket, a boy who manages to escape joining a gang since he is seen as pretty harmless and is the younger brother of one of the early trio of thugs.  Rocket finds his redemption through a camera and actually capitalizes on this brutal underworld to crack the door to a life as a journalistic photographer.  The real story here is the lack of hope and the total desperation from such an early age.  Many scenes are so graphic as to cause this viewer to cringe and even look away from the screen.  Such a powerful, yet sad message delivered by the some of the finest film art one could hope for."
Incredible portrayal of the environment,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,6 July 2009,10,"This is an amazing look into the slums here it is of Rio de Janeiro, but I can imagine it fitting a lot of other cities around the world, as well. It's a threatening, treacherous place, where innocence can only just barely survive, if at all. There are a lot of unconventional methods in this, it could perhaps even be called an experimental film, and it all pays off. The actors are unknowns, and a number of them grew up in the neighborhood this deals with. Not a single performance is lacking, and no one is miscast, and that goes for the children, too. The cinematography and editing also contain untraditional practices, and they aid in the magnificently storytelling. This is cut to evoke the frantic, gritty, and often brutal nature of the life in the slum, and it is unbelievably effective, involving and engaging. The use of music is excellent. This has strong and frequent violence and sexuality, and the language is harsh. The DVD has a well-done, 50-minute long featurette that goes into the process of making it, a nice and funny little 60-second animation, a theatrical trailer and a music video. I recommend this warmly to anyone who watches gang-movies. 10/10"
"From irony to harmony, from dark nation-history to bright movie-history",evandewangga97,12 October 2013,9,"City of God is ironically entertaining. Not only entertaining, I love the way the movie-crew make it so thrilling. I am just not boring at all when watch this movie. So good Brazilian movie. I think it is the best Brazilian movie I've ever watched, or ever made."
hoped that maybe some are still alive,christopher-underwood,8 February 2022,8,"The slum kids of Rio had not just of getting out of there and of being killed. The stupid idea that they seem to have of selling drugs it seems that it really is the only way some times. The raw live of kill or being killed of the running and being just too scared to run the next time. The music and thrill of moving and even little kids have it to kill even little ones or they maybe instead and the music thrills and someone else being killed if they have lived one more day. The film seems almost as amazing as when I first saw it in 2002 and the cinematography is as still so even more surprising that so many of those kids were not actors, it is hoped that maybe some are still alive."
Scorsese on steroids!!,JohnDeSando,12 March 2003,,"Scorsese on steroids: Fernando Meirelles' 'City of God' is more like 'Goodfellas' than 'Gangs of New York, ' but the gritty urban swaggering, gratuitous violence, and lost innocence are there. Rio is New York with favelas even poorer than Harlem's at its worst. Yet the energy and romance of young people of all ages digging out of poverty through crime is there as it was so long ago in Buenel's 'Los Alvidados.' Latinos just do better than gringos in making poverty and crime a story worth something."
(BAD) BOYS FROM BRAZIL,kevin c,18 January 2003,6,"This is an awesome film, that has really set the standards for 2003. The samba score sets a tremendous pace, and the film moves at breath-neck speed. The nod to ""Goodfellas"" is all too obvious. It's witty, well-written, well-acted, and perhaps not as violent as you'd expect. Two scenes stick in the mind, the decision as to which child to kill and the slow-motion strobe-light execution at the party. Are these kids or gangsters? Excellent, don't miss."
"Fast, frenetic and fantastically authentic, this energetically eclectic crime thriller is evocative, lively and emotionally affecting.",Pjtaylor-96-138044,2 December 2017,9,"The energy of 'City Of God (2002)' itself is almost as palpable as that of the bustling city and its often dubious inhabitants, as the film is brought to life with a fantastically frenetic, frankly ferocious vigorous verve simply seldom seen in cinema. It's the combination of the vibrant cinematography and energetic editing with the gritty, almost documentary-esque style of the story that makes the piece feel so realistic and alive. The picture is a sprawling sequence of vignettes depicting the struggles that come when trying to escape the violence that surrounds the gang-heavy slums of Rio De Janeirio. Though at times it seems slightly unfocused as it hops from character to character, its central themes are strong enough to shoot straight through like a well-aimed bullet. Besides, it generally keeps a keen focus on its protagonist, whom is used as a lens through which to view the eclectic events that surround him. In the end, the affair is a lively, evocative, authentic and affecting look at an endless cycle of violence and perhaps the only way to escape it. 9/10."
viewers are humbly advised to look beyond the stylistics,Brawl_666,2 July 2009,9,"'Cidade' has its merits. The photography is unmatched and the editing/structuring is extremely clever. Its an effective and pretty bewildering film, but on subsequent viewings this looks more like a barrage of cinematic tricks and literary devices rather than a study of human nature. All those dazzling stylistics are a knockout on a first viewing, but they also allow passive and ignorant viewers to vicariously enjoy the violence, like an action movie or a cartoon. Thats why this film is so popular. After having recently viewed Slumdog Millionaire, I seriously doubt this film's pretensions to realism. Though I'm sure its still far more factual than SM."
What? Wretched are the poor?,Michael Fargo,3 February 2003,5,"You wouldn't think anyone would get away with exploiting the suffering of children. Here it is bordering on the obscene. No one would question Fernando Meirelles' talent. He seems to have an abundance of it. So much that it gets in the way of his subject. Over and over we get, ""Watch what I can do with a camera or in the editing room!"" It's exhausting."
Top notch Brazilian modern classic,Red-Barracuda,21 September 2017,9,"Fernando Meirelles' City of God is one of the most dynamic and exhilarating crime-dramas to come out since the new millennium. It has a that peculiarly Latin American energy that can be so seductive. Set in and around the favelas of Rio de Janeiro, it looks at the nature of crime in the poor districts of the city and more specifically the way in which abject poverty feeds organised crime and the drug-trade in particular. It also shows the vicious circle, where the young ultimately rise and seize the crown from their marginally older peers, having been corrupted by their exposure to violence and cynicism since they were infants. This is a crime-drama with a clear social conscience and it is this depth which adds considerably to the overall whole. What makes the film so good is that this realistic drama, well-rounded characters and social significance is fused with an unashamedly highly stylized and very cinematic presentation, with audacious camera pans, jump-cuts and various other flashy techniques used to tell the story. These never over-power the story, however, and are used to add to the excitement at the right moments or to convey lots of information effectively."
10 stars for this masterpiece!,pachl,5 November 2005,10,Some people shy away from foreign films because they:
This is as real as it gets...,katzkid,17 April 2007,10,"I must confess that I had no idea whatsoever about the movie before I saw it. Thanks to Adlabs Olive Entertainment, who have brought quality international cinema in my city, Pune."
If you think this movie waste of time. You're WRONG,ehansap,13 December 2018,10,Even the language is in brazilian. It simple straight forward & easy to understand.
A Remarkably Disturbing Portrait Of Life In The Slums Of Rio,CinemaClown,9 August 2013,,"One of the best contemporary films of its or any other time, City of God (also known as Cidade de Deus) is an exceptionally disturbing portrait of life in the slums of Rio de Janeiro that covers the birth & flourishing world of gangsters, gang-wars & drug deals spanning over 3 decades, from 1960s to 1980s, and is narrated from the viewpoint of a young photographer named Rocket who continuously finds himself in the middle of all this despite wanting no part of this world."
People actually hate this film,mcgriswald,1 February 2007,10,"Whenever I look up a film on IMDb, I typically go to the ""hated it"" category and see 1) who is panning it, and 2) what other films they have reviewed and whether or not I share common tastes with the reviewer. Sadly, IMDb doesn't do a good job of filtering out trolls, so there is going to be one star reviews for Citizen Kane type films that aren't really serious, only an attempt to get under people's skin, or possibly an attempt to knock a film down on the Top 250."
Pretty powerful,Red_Identity,12 June 2014,,"Powerful, is pretty much the only word one can use to describe this film upon seeing it. It has an exhilarating pace, some fantastic editing and cinematography, although this same pace sometimes threatens to overwhelm. The performances here are outstanding, but more importantly, fully- realized and they really make an impact. The directing here is pretty amazing, such a great handle at such a controlled artistic vision, very much influenced films like Slumdog Mllionaire in its style. I do wonder just how much of it actually happened, but as a film it's marvelous and totally effective. There's a certain scene that's extremely hard to watch though, so beware."
Where There's No Place For Innocence and Dignity,Chrysanthepop,7 November 2011,,"Fernando Meirelles and co-director Kátia Lund just about get everything right in 'Cidade de Deus'. On the technical side, it's absolutely amazing, whether you're talking about the remarkable direction, the electrifying cinematography, the haunting raw visuals, the energetic yet eery score, the excellent editing, authentic art direction or stunningly real performances. Bráulio Mantovani's screenplay is rich in grit, dark humour and starkness. The eclectic cinematography varies from close ups, freeze-and-zoom to sweeping motion scenes, long shots and hand-held approach. The depiction of the title city is metaphorically described in the film as purgatory that transforms to hell and the way Meirelles portrays it makes it easy to draw the conclusion that it's one of the most frightening and dangerous places in the world. The fact that it's based on real events and that it still exists sends a chill. 'Cidade de Deus' is a film that haunts. It lingers in mind long after one has finished watching. However, the film, while intense and chaotic, is cleverly balanced with dark humour."
What a true story...,Thanos_Alfie,16 August 2013,9,"""City of God"" it's a movie which has to do about two different children who take different paths, one becomes a photographer and the other one a drug dealer. It's based on the true story of the photographer (Buscapé - Rocket)."
Brazilian Cinema shows how to make a Masterpiece Gangsters Film to the World..,SAMTHEBESTEST,2 June 2020,9,"City Of God (2002) :
Brief Review -"
We Know Who the Chicken Is - City of God,arthur_tafero,12 August 2021,8,"The chicken in this movie represents the filmmaker himself. He is constantly trying to save his feathers throughout the film. The movie is relentlessly violent, but then that is exactly what denizens of this area face every day; a test of survival that makes Boyz in the Hood, Gangs of New York and Clockers look like Disney productions in comparison. Dodge City is a convent compared to this place. This film is not for the squeamish or pacifists. The only peace these unfortunate kids will find is getting out of this place. Great filmmaking from beginning to end. Just as good as many of the neo-realism films of post-war Italy that made Italian directors famous."
This film's production quality it's 100.,kateparis-72298,23 July 2020,10,They actually shoot it in favelas with real people that live there. This must have been really hard to shoot. Congrats to all crew. The other thing is beyond the difficulties to shoot there they actually produced a really nice movie. If we don't give to this movie 10 then where are you going to give it?
City of God,cesarfrancopro,12 October 2020,9,City of God is a big showcase of the brutality of living in the slums of Rio De Janeiro. Director Fernando Meirelles does this masterfully by showing us the endless cycle of violence these families go through by showing how deep the roots of these gangs go with multiple family members being shown throughout the film as wanting to join the gang because of a past family member being killed due to violence in the slums. Meirelles shows the audience the sad reality of these gangs as most members are children who partake in violent shootings and robberies which shocked me at how easily some of these crimes were committed by the children.
Subjective taste is crucial...,Bored_Dragon,21 August 2019,8,"Rio's favelas are ruled by poverty and the struggle for survival. Teenagers and even children are turning to crime and only the most violent and the most unscrupulous survive. And even then only until someone even crazier comes along to kill them off and replace them. This explicitly brutal film portrays such a life very realistically, at the same time criticizing the state of society and giving a glimmer of hope that it may still be possible to get out of it all. Shocking story with a strong message, superbly shot for relatively little money. The impression is even stronger when you take into account that in most roles are not professional actors, but children who grow up in such an environment and contribute firsthand to the script. The ending, while somewhat expected, further intensifies the story, and I cannot point to any specific flaws of this film. However, it did not emotionally move me nearly as much as is necessary for the highest rating. Maybe it's up to the movie, maybe it's up to me, but I can't go over"
A little thought,mashaoxiang,29 October 2020,10,"Ambitious people tend to be able to do great things, let alone those who have a clear consciousness when they are young."
Hard-hitting but exhausting,briancham1994,7 June 2021,7,"Watching a film about child gangsters establishing a drug empire in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro was never going to be pleasant, but this film went far beyond my expectations. It's disturbing, bloody and brutal, made worse by the harsh naturalistic style that raises the tensions. The storyline is true to life - anyone can die at any moment and characters weave in and out of the picture as they are shot and replaced. The acting is naturalistic and energetic, which gives a dynamic presence to the characters. My main concern is that there were far too many characters, flashbacks and narrations to keep track of, which made the plot a bit messy."
Perfection?,krayzagario,9 March 2022,10,"After about 10 minutes of thinking about the things I did not like about this movie... I couldn't find anything except for one of the characters dying so soon, but that just means I grew an attachment to a character... So, I guess that's a good thing? Anyways, great movie. Definitely worth a watch."
Gritty and Sad,billcr12,10 August 2012,7,"City of God is a suburb of Rio de Janeiro, a place notorious for its violent crime. Three thieves, known as The Tender Trio; Shaggy, Clipper, and Goose, rob various places and split up the money with the residents of the city, sort of modern day Robin Hoods. Lil Dice comes up with idea of robbing a motel. He is the lookout, and is told to fire a warning shot if the police show up. Instead, he guns down several of the patrons; an extremely bad idea, as it draws the attention of the lawmen of Brasil."
"Dark, haunting, brilliant, but most of all, memorable.",insomniac_rod,17 May 2009,10,"""Cidade de Deus"" is one of those it's so crude but it's sad but true movies that will exist."
city of god,marmar-69780,13 May 2020,8,"City of god is one very violent film since its idea is based on gang wars in rio favelas and how it shows that kids there dont have normal life and they can only become criminals if they want survive in that life,it also shows how criminal life can effect also normal people who try to build normal lifes for themselfs like in this film character of photographer but still his friends and tough life puts them back in a hole with a hard way out,even though this guys who acted in a film arent professional actors they still give great job,direction is sometimes messy and there are to many characters interduced to fast so i didnt have time to care or to relate to them,city of god is one of best south american films and it shows how criminal life and its problem is a big deal even today"
The price of freedom?,shneur,1 October 2005,8,"This is a very interesting presentation of the ongoing war among drug dealing gangs in Rio de Janeiro and between all of them and often corrupt government authorities. Much emphasis is placed upon the involvement of children, both as victims and perpetrators of the violence, and as beneficiaries of the large drug profits. I thought the treatment was unexpectedly evenhanded. As children have been excluded, by ""modernizers"" and other ""do-gooders,"" from the legitimate economies of very poor countries, those who are unwilling or unable to bear the second-class status of dependents have been forced more and more into crime and/or soldiering to attain a status of respect. Of course total rejection of the very thought that any child might be conscious of or desire respect and self-sufficiency is itself an integral part of the disrespect to which they are subjected. It should be noted that the DVD includes also an actual documentary, almost as long as the movie."
VIOLENT MOVIE - WHAT A LIFE,iohefy-2,13 February 2004,6,"I really don't know what to make of this movie.  It was very well done, but what a hell of life this people live.  It starts at the age of 6 or 7 years and continues us to death.  Seeing children of this age getting guns to protect themselves, or kill someone.  There was more gunfire in this movie then in World War 2.  Go see it, but you have to have a strong stomach for violence."
A whirlwind of virtuoso filmmaking,Chris Knipp,4 May 2003,,"""Cidade de Deus"" (City of God) begins with a chase after an escaped chicken and it's a mad rush from then on in this mind-boggling autobiography of a favela dweller who works his way out of the slums into mainstream Rio de Janeiro by becoming a photographer (in the original book he's a writer but this change toward the visual is a smart one).  Fernando Meirelles and Kátia Lund have forged a truly amazing movie: people are absolutely dazzled by the vibrancy of the action and the sheer brilliance of the filmmaking. Indeed, ""Cidade de Deus"" is a technical wonder, bursting with virtuoso effects that never distract from the action.  True, there is a degree of violence that sometimes makes people walk out of the auditorium midway.  Some viewers and some critics complain there's so much killing that you're numbed.  But whether we like this movie or not, we have to acknowledge its stunning craftsmanship.  And observers say that though the slums of Rio have cleaned up and quieted down in the last decade, what the movie shows is true to life."
Violence and Disregard Begets Violence and Disregard,drqshadow-reviews,5 August 2020,9,"A hauntingly real dive into Rio's seedy side, exploring the turf wars and drug scene of the city's worst neighborhood during the culture-rich 1970s. Beginning with an uncomfortably close look at their hopeless childhood living conditions, we see how, for many of these kids, guns and violence are literally their only chance at getting a leg up on life."
"The Movie, the Watchers and the IMDB",AleksandrBelenko,11 January 2019,7,"Let me start from afar. If you actively use the database and read users' reviews you might be a little bit confused about pretty much everything.
The worst movie presented on the site can have a lot of 10/10s and praising comments. As well as the best movie, currently ""Shawshank Redemption"" can have many 1/10s saying that it does not deserve to be the best movie, or even saying that it is actually one of the worst movies ever.
I understand that for each person each movie feels subjective and one person will like something that the other person will not.
But in such case as this people that think that movie is ok or even good would give the lowest grade to drop the number of the movie on the list of 250 bests.
I currently is on the marathon of IMDB's best movies, and ""City of God"" is in top 20, so I couldn't miss it. And before watching I couldn't resist temptation of reading some reviews. Oh man, so many people hate this movie. Yet it is here in the top list. That actually made it more interesting to me. Why is so?
And here is my opinion: the movie is not bad. If you don't pay attention from the start you might dislike the movie. Otherwise it is nice criminal story with no romantizing of bandit life. Do I think it deserves to be in top of all time? Probably not. But that is solely my opinion.
In conclusion, it is decent gangster movie about simple kids. And that is all. No more no less. Not a masterpiece, yet not a piece of you know what. Just watch it and make up your own opinion, as did I."
Among the 5 best movies of all time,hagner2,24 January 2011,10,"This movie is sure amazing. If it was a American movie, probably would receive higher rater here in IMDb. I fact, I am surprise the a foreign language movie receive so good reviews, because watch this movie in original language (I am Brazilian) is so much more involving than the dubbed version. The language itself plays a role, because there are a peculiar way of expression that the characters uses. Is sad to say that the power of words is lost in translation."
POWERFUL FILM.,andrewchristianjr,24 February 2020,7,"Powerful film. A great show of rise to power and downfalls. Personally, I saw this film more as a documentary of the City of God rather than an entertainment film."
Amazing movie,jchrisj34,9 May 2020,10,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film. Wonderful characters, cityscape and views of the city."
Best Foreign Film,estebangonzalez10,16 September 2010,10,"City of God is the best foreign film I have seen and is among my favorite all time movies. Fernando Meirelles does a terrific (and terrifying) job as he puts together this movie with great performances from the actors, great cinematography (it seemed so real), and great storytelling. I loved the style in which this film was presented with smart flashbacks and pauses (the narration was perfect). Overall great film. Life is Beautiful was my favorite foreign film, but I have to admit this film was a bit better. Meirelles makes Ciudad de Dios so real with great characters that intersect with one another at different points of the film. This movie was perfectly made. Fernando takes us into the life of the favelas and we experience it in a very realistic form (raw and violent but true). Great film and a must see."
One of the Best Moves of All Time,tysonmorris2008,29 June 2010,10,"Much of my own sentiments have already been echoed by other posted reviews here. As my rating indicates, I consider this one of the finest movies of all time. It's something of a Brazilian ""Goodfellahs."" A coming of age story, a mafia story. An urban ""Lord of the Flies."" There are a myriad of virtues to single out in such an epic triumph such as this, but I'd like to simply draw attention to one of the most gripping pieces of acting I've ever seen in film -- and it's that of the young boy who faces the drawn gun of another young boy. The scene comes in the middle of the movie and it is mesmerizing and horrific. It's a representation of the intensity of the film as a whole."
"without doubt, one of the best movies I've ever seen..",zorasmoon,24 June 2005,10,"The cinematography, score, story-telling & casting were all done to perfection."
One word: Powerful,julian_abadia,5 May 2009,10,"City of god is the most powerful movie I've seen. Period. Is it the best one?. No, but it should be considered as one of the best."
"Why return to the City of God, where God forgets about you?",alansabljakovic-39044,3 December 2019,9,I watched this about 3 years ago when I first started watching movies and didn't really appreciate it enough tbh. After rewatching it I realised how many great shots I missed the first time. Cinematography and editing are on points and story is very interesting. Something like Goodfellas and The Godfather in one.
get r done,almostmorning,22 March 2005,10,"a movie you could show to the ""I don't want to read when I watch a movie get r done"" types and they would thank you at the end. when it ends you feel as if you just stepped off some great roller coaster ride, your bloods flowing and you just start brain storming who should I tell first about this!!! What can I say about this movie... I love I bought two days after I watched it and went on a spree of making my friends watch it with me. I normally don't go on about a movie like this, so I hope you understand how important this movie is to my home collection when ever I try to choose a movie to watch at night I have to tell myself no just so I don't over play it. It's like food for a fat kid it just sits their staring at you, saying, ""pick me you know you love it."""
Reality.,lucasespindola-91322,22 January 2021,9,"Almost 20 years later, Cidade de Deus still is one of the best representations of day to day life in a reality that, for most moviegoers, is fantasy. This is a reality that, for brazilians, isn't a surprise. Nevertheless, the movie creates a sense of familiarity with it, as if the viewer is part of the favela.
The constant violence and the looming poverty are characters as much as Zé Pequeno or Buscapé, in a world that doesn't create excuses for wrong behavior. No one is a hero nor a villain; we are simply watching lives in a place forgotten by god itself.
It is brutal, sad and real. It is a reality that shouldn't exist but does, and it is a movie that deserves all the praise it gets."
Moviemaking of a high order,rogerdarlington,25 June 2003,,Cidade de Deus is actually a huge favela or slum on the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro and this is a nightmare vision that I had no idea of when I visited Rio itself as the start of a South American tour. Originally this was a best-selling novel by Paulo Lins who lived in the area and spent eight years interviewing and researching for his shocking work. Now it is a stunning film which is the first to be directed solely by Fernando Meirelles who is based in São Paolo.
"A kid? I smoke, I snort. I've killed and robbed. I'm a man.",lastliberal-853-253708,5 November 2013,9,"I don't know why I have not seen this film until now. But, it is very timely as the World Cup and Olympics are coming to Barazil very soon, and I well imagine that many people wonder if things have really changed in the last 50 years."
"A harrowing, gripping and moving account of life in Rio de Janeiro",DVD_Connoisseur,24 March 2007,,"""City of God"" is an incredible achievement. Set in Rio de Janeiro's City of God, the film follows events in the lives of a number of gangsters from the '60s to the '80s."
Overly violent,raulfaust,20 September 2013,8,"In my point of view, it has got to be one of the most violent movies I've ever seen. From the moment the murderers start, we feel like watching a Tarantino's production-- in big style, may I say. ""Cidade de Deus"" is a movie that shows a violent community in 1970's Brazil, specially in the city of Rio de Janeiro, which is known by it's enormous social difference. There are plots and subplots, with a relatively fast screenplay, which is necessary to show everything they wanted to. Whilst some are used with cruelness in movies, I admit I thought this was too exaggerated, and sometimes, even implausible. For instance: why would ""Zé Pequeno"" kill and hunt everybody out there and nobody could do anything? There are lots of bad guys in this movie that could have easily killed him if they wanted to, but writers preferred to let him live until the end. Other than that, there are great performances, with an engaging plot that makes you enjoy some characters, and even understand why they're going those things. It may not be a beautiful movie, but it's the biggest Brazilian production to this day, and I'm proud of that. Congratulations."
Realistic indeed,valadas,8 January 2006,7,"This is the story of the fight between two gangs for the control of a ""favela"" called ""Cidade de Deus"" (City of God) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The story develops against a background of poverty, squalor and lawlessness where the values which are obeyed are those imposed by the gangs. We see even children possessing and using guns, killing and robbing at ease. The images are extremely realistic and the cast without exception does a superb performance. The cut was made in syncopated scenes with lots of short flashbacks with the intention of conferring a vivid rhythm to the movie but revealing themselves sometimes excessive. The dialogues are also very realistic and full of strength. A good movie almost a masterpiece of its kind."
"From the beginning of the film, the atmosphere of chicken flying and dog jumping was rendered.",yoggwork,18 February 2019,9,"From the beginning of the film, the atmosphere of chicken flying and dog jumping was rendered. Then, by means of the main danger of inserting branches, we slowly show you a barbaric living space. Every actor is very involved."
"Frantic, violent, and depressing",bandw,18 February 2007,8,"Movies such as this present a problem for me in trying to rate them. I recognize the quality in just about every category, but I don't feel that I got a return on the emotional commitment I made to the story, about life in a Rio de Janeiro slum."
Could Be Considered Modern Mythology if it weren't True!,Erniehem2,1 April 2005,10,"This is quite possible the best foreign I've ever seen. I'm a fan of Fellini, of Bergman, they were artist and insightful philosophers, but the gritty reality of City of God is fascinating and unparalleled."
A great addition to the gangster genre,eddsj,21 March 2005,9,City of God is based on the true events of a young man growing up watching everything around him is destroyed. Families are changed and friendships are destroyed so that each character can escape the ghetto that consumes his life.
Social apartheid,stensson,20 March 2004,8,"This is like a documentary with nervous shivering camera work, but still telling a story and telling it in a good way. The movie has a rumour of being very violent and it is of course, because of the subject: Gang wars in Rio."
how i feel about C of G,leonardpart6,25 October 2007,10,"i remember a boy, chasing another boy through a filthy slum, the cops after a kid, people confused, hope flickering then falling, being blotted out by the anger and apathy and despondency that comes with poverty of the body and spirit."
Don't be confused by the thriving Brazil?,tonypeacock-1,6 January 2022,8,2003 Brazilian film. The title of which refers to a Rio de Janiero housing project that in reality evolves into a poverty stricken slum.
A movie so riveting... you won't ever forget it or regret seeing it,arisebabylon,7 November 2007,10,"This movie really captured me. I am very critical about certain movies, but this one was so well presented and was so gripping and powerful, there is no way you can't walk away from this movie without feeling like you were there in the City of God. The character's faces will stay stuck in your head for days and you will see Brazil in a whole new light."
A magnificent film,rdoyle29,19 October 2017,10,"This Brazilian film is extremely reminiscent of ""Goodfellas"" in the way it tells a complex story with many characters and jumps around in time, telling a story up to a point, and then jumping back to establish more context. It's also a visually inventive and immensely entertaining story about criminals, told from the POV of someone in the middle of the action, and creates understanding about why these people are criminals without compromising on the brutal nature of their lives. It's also, like ""Goodfellas"", loosely based on fact. This isn't just like ""Goodfellas"", it's almost as good as it."
I'm losing my credit for IMDb rates,ugur-20,20 July 2009,1,Was what I just watched really the film all the hype was about? I really can't believe what makes people be so shallow and appreciate that movie- like crap. Was that a movie actually in the first place or just an emotionless documentary about Brazilian crime-stricken streets? I'm asking because I really don't know and am still wondering how come such an abject movie can even get so famous and be rated so high in IMDb.
Another Stolen Oscar,ValterVoghen,14 September 2021,10,"And again, the Academy stole the statue from a brazilian movie (Fernanda on Central Station was the 1st). Their lost! This movie is a masterpiece!"
Realistic!,brandon_lee420,26 February 2010,2,"City of god or also known as Cidade De Deus seemed to me like a boring, overlong, not worth watching kind of movie but surprisingly I actually enjoyed the film for its realism. The setting for the film is gritty and painful, in a way, if you look at it from a different perspective. IT seemed desolate yet full of life as well. It is not my favorite film nor is it my worst but somewhere in the middle because it is slow at times and gets really exciting when the story takes a new turn or when a new character is introduced. The narration made the film for what it is and it was really needed because without it it would have seemed like a waste of time but, thankfully, it didn't reach that. The film explores violence, innocence, and sexuality so some would not like it e.g. old people. Sorry! Had to say that. It is just that they are frightened so easily and are so fragile with the exception of Clint Eastwood. The film also made me realize that Rio de Janeiro was different and more psycho than it is now. Guns are now festivals being held in the street. It also made me realize what gangsters and gangster-wannabes would to in order to cause havoc and chaos along with making kids and people lose their innocence. The part where they shoot the kids on their legs and hands was gruesome and disturbing but what was even more disturbing was that a 12 year old kid had to finish one of them off. So sad and honest! The film does not hold back it's violence because if they did the film would have less of an impact on me and some other views. Fernando Meirelles was a great director and the City Of God is without a doubt his best work so far. His great sense of direction and casting made this film work for me and it didn't disappoint. But of course he wasn't perfect and I felt that some scenes were unnecessary and could have been done without plus it would have made the film shorter and sweeter. Who hates nothing more than a slow boring movie that has no point? The great acting from Alexandre Rodriguez was enough to make him the star of the show. Phellipe Haagensen was second so don't you worry about.................anything!?"
A masterpiece of foreign cinema.,bobsgrock,13 March 2008,10,"Foreign cinema is not new at making great films. Akira Kurosawa, Jean Luc-Godard, and many others have all made films that stand the test of time as well as any American classic. For the Brazilian cinema, City of God is that film. It is a perfect blend of three separate stories that all come together in the end. Telling the tale of how the main gangs in the City of God came to be, the film superbly balances the subject material of each story, never giving one more than the other. The screenplay is terrific; it never falters or sags and continuously keeps us guessing what will happen next. The acting is very good, a surprise since virtually none of the cast had ever acted before in a film. The real treasure of the film, though, is the visual style. The directing is superb with an incredible blend of hand-held, dolly shots, and track shots among others. The cinematography as well perfectly captures the gritty street life with excellent lighting and sets. Overall, the film is a cinematic wonder. It is quite possibly one of the best films of the decade and certainly one of the best foreign films in quite a while."
The title is from Augustine,wikipediacabal,29 September 2011,,Great film. It is named after the Rio de Janeiro neighborhood where it is set. But there is a second meaning. The neighborhood was named City of God after a concept in Catholic and early Christian thinking.
Classic of the Brazilian film,miguelneto-74936,2 August 2016,9,"City of God is Brazilian masterpiece that deserved the Oscar for best foreign film without doubt , the cast was unknown at the time, few actors in this film still works , an example is the beautiful Alice Braga making too Hollywood movies ( I Am Legend ) , the performances are excellent , especially the actors who did Buscapé and Zé Pequeno , the picture is very good, the script is good , the direction of Fernando Meirelles is very good, even though moments you see the camera waver, the director shows the unfortunate reality of many places , has great moments , Zé Pequeno at times seemed quite exaggerated, the makeup is very good , City of God is perhaps the best Brazilian film ever made , the performances are excellent , has striking scenes and the soundtrack is very good. Note 9.5"
What an Experience!,conormarshall,9 February 2023,10,"Writing this as an 18 year old, I sometimes find that certain films from before i was born have been hyped up to me so much that, though i usually still enjoy them, they can't quite live up to my expectations. City of God is an exception that enthralled me from the jump."
"Spectacular cinematography for a gritty ""true story.""",Benjamin-M-Weilert,5 July 2019,9,"About a decade ago, I saw a clip from City of God (2002) in my Film Studies course at college. One of my classmates brought it to show everyone how realistic the acting appeared during a scene where young children were initiated into a gang. I had to admit that the acting seemed authentic. However, I didn't consider it as part of the whole movie until recently, when I had a chance to sit down and watch the entire thing. While I'll agree that this short clip was a good example of what the film had to offer, I was more in awe of plenty of other aspects it brought to the table."
Groundbreaking demonstration of cinematic shocks,Stampsfightclub,30 March 2010,9,"Aspiring photographer Rocket (Rodrigues) recounts the story of the Brazilian slums and the times run by Li'l Ze (Firmino) and his gang When Slumdog Millionaire was released a few years ago it was critically praised for its sharp depiction of the African slums and the difficulty of Dev Patel's character's life and encoding that with a popular TV programme and heart warming love story, and so if you were a fan, prepare to have your mind warped by one of the darkest and violent slum films arguably ever created."
Extremely violent movie,mtaraskevicius,14 June 2008,1,"If you like blood, violence, death, seeing people being rapped and murdered, then this is the perfect movie for you. I could not finish watching this movie because it is so graphic. What a disgusting movie! I regret watching 1/2 of it. It makes me embarrassed to be Brazilian, because it makes it look like we are all criminals. I would NOT recommend this movie to any normal person, avoid it like you would avoid the plague. You can show violence without being so graphic, they showed a really bad rape scene. What is going on with some Brazilian film makers? There's no need to so something like that. I cannot understand why there are so many people who love this movie, maybe they are nutty!"
Cidade de Deus,chains01,14 October 2009,10,"Many movies try to recreate the real world, giving us a ""true"" story that's supposed to be gripping, gritty, and scary but never completely accomplishing the goal. Other times we get movies that would appear to give us what we were expecting if it weren't for the fact that they've been done over and over again. In 2002, though, Fernando Meirelles gave us a new story that showed us a new world. Focusing on the true story of Rocket as he grows up around the gangs in Cidade de Deus, a neighborhood in Rio de Janiero where gangs of children ran free to rob, loot, and deal drugs, City of God feels more like a documentary than a dramatic theatrical film."
A sweeping tale of how crime affects the poor population of Rio de Janeiro.,khanbaliq2,30 June 2010,8,"A promising young photographer (Alexandre Rodrigues) attempts to stay out of a gang war unfolding between his contemporaries in the slums of Rio de Janeiro. In the United Kingdom the film was ranked 3rd in Film4's ""50 Films to See Before You Die""."
Exceptional,patrikpozun,10 November 2018,10,"Fernando Meirelles and Kátia Lund are taking you on a journey through the gruesome and painful life of the inhabitants of the Cidade de Deus. Throughout the movie you become a part of this society which leads to an even better understanding of the horrible details this city has to offer. Some scenes are highly disturbing while others are simply beautiful. This change between good and bad gives this film even more strenght.
The acting is astounding and so is the entire atmosphere in every part of the movie.
For me this is one of the best movies in all of movie history and unfortunately a very underrated piece of art."
They shoot people in opera's don't they...,ThurstonHunger,11 July 2004,8,"Yes this is a violent film that will turn the stomach inside-out (and the eyes away) for many viewers.  While I'm more worried about those who might laugh at sections of the film, some people who feel like they already get more than enough of their daily allowance of vitamin violence, I guess should skip this film."
What in God's name...?,jannagal,5 August 2004,10,"Sometimes people make mistakes.  My mistake was giving this movie an 8. The frenetic pace, and chaotic style of film-making was somewhat distracting. Also, with a Portugese dialog, and English subtitles, I wondered if anything was ""lost in translation."""
One of the best movies I've seen,mitsubishizero,7 March 2018,10,As someone who loves movies (especially foreign movies) I thought this movie was well directed and well acted (especially when the actors were told to improvise sometimes). I remember watching this movie twice when I was ( and still am) interested in learning Brazilian Portuguese. It's a gritty tale yet one that still has hope. One thing I thought was a little weird was how some of the names were changed in the subtitles.
Raw!!!,sriramthestranger,18 December 2020,9,Sometimes reality is stranger than fiction. This is one such movie. The camera is always on the move and editing transitions are just fantastic. I have never seen such a movie totally captured around slums and their lifestyle. Well made film!!
Excellent film!,jp101010,17 October 2018,10,"Fernando Meirelles & Kátia Lund's film City of God is a truly fascinating film that deeply & poignantly displays the cycle of poverty & crime in the impoverished slums near Rio de Janeiro from the 60's to 80's. Displaying large volumes of emotional turmoil, this film speaks to the entrapment of people in a repetitive cycle of violence and despair by showing us the brutality and violence of what they experience on a daily basis. Primarily through the storytelling of the lead character Rocket we are invited to witness how the shameless drug lords running his city, along with the help of a corrupt police department that sustains the turning of the cycle, destroys the lives of many innocent people. 
 After watching, it felt as though one cannot help but feel their helplessness. And as for the frequent and disturbing acts of violence perpetuated by male dominance in this film, they are perhaps too much to watch more than once. In terms of the film's perspective lens its structure of an interconnected narrative shared between many different characters really allows the viewer to see all the differing aspects of the burden that poverty & crime inflicts on people. They all experience it in some way or another, and it positions us to confront the ugly side of human nature by forcing us to empathize with loss in profoundly penetrating ways. Overall, this film is incredibly compelling and could be described as achieving a great deal of realism especially in terms of its ending. I recommend watching this film."

City of God,auuwws,9 August 2021,9,"A great movie, I did not expect it to be this level, the story of the movie was amazing and took a look at the slums, and I liked that the story was telling the beginning of Li,ll Ze's entry into the criminal world to his downfall at the end, and I did not expect that the children would be the ones who would kill him, acting in The movie was good, it wasn't amazing, it wasn't bad, I highly recommend watching it."

A Great Story with an Excellent Color Pallet,One2Three4Five,7 March 2019,10,"I usually don't read reviews with a 10/10 so I didn't want to put a 10/10, but honestly I can't find anything wrong with this film.

An Unexpected Great,clerkmallrat,27 May 2007,10,"With pseudo elements of The Godfather, this motion picture is one of those movies that will hold on to you from beginning to end. In this tale of poverty, corruption, and death in the seedy underworld of one of the most beautiful countries on earth: Brazil. This tale is of a young man by the name of Rocket, and as the narrator he is reluctant to tell you every bit of this story. Tracing from his days as a young boy in the sixties to his days as a freelance photographer in the disco era of the 1970's all in the City Of God. But do not let the name fool you because in the City Of God you only find devils and demons. The story follows the tales of the most notorious gangsters, hoodlums, and family all somehow linked to each other. Any fans of the Drama Genre would enjoy this cinematic masterpiece."
"Tough stuff, but well worth viewing",justahunch-70549,25 August 2022,9,"Supposedly based on a true story, this is a very effective, very harsh and extremely well directed film about growing up in slums of Rio de Janeiro. For most, the only way to survive is to become a criminal, but this is a tale of two who went in completely opposite directions. The acting by all is perfection, the cinematography is alive with brutality and it is quite an experience to view. It's not really entertainment and it's not for the squeamish, but it's an excellently made look at life in a place you wouldn't want to be a part of."
Feels authentic,bgar-80932,30 June 2019,8,"I don't have time for much of a review but I will give a few thoughts while they are fresh. Whoever directed this did a great job of showing the time pass as well as giving a real feel of the life in the slums there. Only after the movie did I realize it was based on a true story which makes sense because it seemed so authentic. Life is just different there. Morality and mortality are thought of differently there than for those of us who have lived an easy life. It made me care for the good guys. I was pretty damn sad when Benny got put down even though I knew he would. I was pretty happy Rocket made it out when the cards were against him. That's a sign of a good movie to me, when it actually makes me care about the characters, most don't."
College students love this film,redjackco,24 January 2012,10,"I have shown this film in my classes at Minnesota State University Mankato and offered it as an assignment and extra credit. Either way, it is perhaps the only film of the dozens I've shown that my predominantly Midwestern students have universally liked. For some — maybe even most — it may be the first non-English language film they're ever seen."
Talk about overkill!,arlened324,14 February 2004,7,"Great reviews.  Disappointed by the relentless violence.  Had no idea this was based on a true story because of the excess.  As seems to be the case in 2004, graphic violence is supposed to make and help us feel the impossible situation of the poor slum kids.  It doesn't.  Damn it.  Is there anyone who remembers that the story of one, only one, victimized character is more powerful than watching millions of people slaughtered."
An educational and stunning film that has tons of action,patpiw,7 October 2019,10,"City of God is a one of a kind movie that not only is educational but a masterpiece in the form of sound, editing, and filming. The movie did a great job of starting in the present and then jumping back into the past in order for the audience to understand the story and how that specific scene came about. The use of different camera angles as well as movement played a huge role in the making of the film as well. By using a handheld camera as well as a dolly gave different feelings and almost made the audience feel like they were in the Rio favela. The use of sound as well played a role into this great movie. The music that was used in specific scenes played gave a great feeling as well. When there was action or tension, the music played was at a quicker tempo which made the audience feel that action and or tension. Lighting as well was used terrifically in the movie because as the audience gets more into the film the lighting gets darker and darker to show the bad that is going on. The directors Fernando Meirelles and Katia Lund did a fantastic job finding amateur actors who were from favelas to play the roles of the characters like Rocket who actually live in the Cidade de Deus. By finding actors who have actually been in these scenarios they can pull actual emotion on how it feels and what is going on. Lastly, the fact that this movie is based on a real story is where this movie is educational. To see the problem with drugs not only with marijuana but cocaine and how it affected everyone around them really opens the eyes of the audience. This movie is a must see not only for entertainment but for education as I said before."
Stunning movie,chanonpenvari,6 October 2019,10,"The City of God is the movie that fulfills with camera technique, unique choice of color, fast storyline, sharp editing, and memorable soundtrack. Even though many actors in these films was an amateur actor but César Charlone (cinematographer) uses his camera technique to help the character to shine in this film. Right at the beginning of the movie a scene after chicken chase, Rocket (Main Character) was standing in the middle between Liz Ze Gangster and the Police. César Charlone uses handheld camera movement circular around Rocket from the low angle in a fast motion before a cut and transition to Rocket childhood story. I think this is one of the best flashback transitions I have seen. The tone of color in this film considered very vividly. At the beginning of the film, the tone that is used was light blue, surrounded by tall concrete buildings. Then after the transition, Rocket's childhood story color tone was light brown/yellow given a warm feeling. Since the flashbacks, if looked at this film closely, when the story progresses the color tone slowly transition from light to dark. The scene when Benny was being shot, when a high camera angle and a long shot was used, the tone of the setting was considered grey to black. This film was using a powerful scene right at the beginning that creating a reflecting on the people of Cidade de Deus. This movie will circle and meet the first scene at the end of the movie. In the beginning, the chicken is running away from the people because it saw its friend being killed. The chicken decides to runways as fast as possible without looking back. The chicken symbolizes the people in Cidade de Deus, there are only two choices to choose from, to join the gang and be killed or runaways as far as possible. Rocket choose to run away to pursue his photographer career but he did not run far enough, eventually, he ends up back at the city. This film speaks for itself, the story that people avoid to talk about has spoken through this film."
Good!,Gunnar_Runar_Ingibjargarson,19 June 2008,8,"Like cinematic dynamite, City of God lights a fuse under its squalid Brazilian ghetto, and we're a captive audience to its violent explosion. The titular fa vela is home to a seething army of impoverished children who grow, over the film's ambitious 20-year time frame, into cutthroat killers, drug lords, and feral survivors. In the vortex of this maelstrom is L'IL Z (Leandro Firmino DA Hora--like most of the cast, a nonprofessional actor), self-appointed king of the dealers, determined to eliminate all competition at the expense of his corrupted soul. With enough visual vitality and provocative substance to spark heated debate (and box-office gold) in Brazil, co directors Fernando Meirelles and Kátia Lund tackle their subject head on, creating a portrait of youthful anarchy so appalling--and so authentically immediate--that City of God prompted reforms in socioeconomic policy. It's a bracing feat of stylistic audacity, borrowing from a dozen other films to form its own unique identity. You'll flinch, but you can't look away."
One of the greatest pictures of all-time that makes you think,OriginalMovieBuff21,18 February 2005,10,"As I scrolled down through the television channels, I popped up to Cidade de Deus(City of God) on Encore, the channels where you can see the whole thing without commercials, a lot like HBO. Well I've always wanted to see this movie, since it got 4 stars and got an 8.7 rating on IMDb. So I finished the movie with a big grin on my face, knowing that I just watched on the most powerful, brutal, and one of the greatest films of all-time. The camera view, acting, cinematography, and dialogue were all astonishing but I finally got to see my first one and I'm just so happy by seeing it. One of the greatest films, for sure. Makes you think after you see the film. I highly recommend the movie!!"
Real eye opener,the-movie-guy,12 February 2004,,"The City of God is the name of a city slum in Rio de Janeiro.  The movie is so shocking in the amount of violence that takes place in these streets, that it is one place you must not go.  The movie follows the lives of several kids who grow up in the slums during the 60's, 70's, and 80's.  Some kids took the path of crime, violence and the drug trade, and others tried to escape the slum.  The senseless violence in this movie was so brutal that even the cops wouldn't go into the slums without a squad of men.  It looked like all the teenagers had a gun, and they would use it if anybody looked the wrong way.  One of the kids, Buscape became a photographer for a newspaper, and this story was described and seen through his eyes.  The movie is a real eye opener on how little life is worth in other parts of the world.  The movie is not in English and has subtitles.  (Miramax Films, Run Time 1:30, Rated R) (6/10)"
City of God,matthewhardin,7 October 2019,10,"The City of God (2002), directed by Fernando Meirelles and Katia Lund tells the story of a group of neighborhood boys that grew up in the ghetto in Rio de Janeiro, which is based on true story. The film is directed a way that contains multiple stories or chapters, to explain how their neighborhood evolved the way it did. Each of the main characters has their own chapter to show their evolution throughout the film. It contains acts of drugs, sex, violence throughout this the story, and the actors did a brilliant job recreating the storyline. This film applies different lighting, camera angles/elements and music play an important role when creating this film. The film utilizes a handheld camera to capture certain moments that allowed the audience to view events as how the charters would have. Due to the main character Rocket main desire to become a photographer, the directors utilize this plot story fact to show much of the film through his eyes. The music indicates what is building up in the film, such as upbeat and fast music playing when violence is on the horizon. Although this film contains such a strong presence of violence that leads you turn your head at moments, this element demonstrates the disgusting reality of the lively hood of people who live in slums such as this. I rate this film a 10/10 due to the accurate representation of gangs, poverty and crime. There is such a heavy presence of suspense, that it keeps viewers on the edge of their seats and constantly eager for what is to come. Overall an unforgettable film and a cinematic masterpiece."
"A very very terrific Brazilian film that is completely raw in characters, language and depiction.",braddugg,20 September 2014,10,"A very very terrific Brazilian film that is completely raw in characters, language and depiction."
Eye opening,shermanmclawhorn,7 October 2019,6,SPOILER ALERT
"This is not like American gangster films,",bretttaylor-04022,19 July 2022,9,This is such a grim and at times uncomfortable watch but still a must watch.
Relentless and Powerful,shark-43,3 January 2004,,"This film is incredibly well made and very powerful. The violence, the poverty, the ignorance, the complete lack of respect for human life becomes relentless and after all, numbing but that is the point. There is no hope anywhere in the slums and the gangs become the only thing there is. The performances are amazing - incredibly strong. Quite violent. A Brazil Scarface, Good Fellas and The Killing all rolled into one. Check this film out. One of the best of the year."
"Powerful presentation of a sad, seemingly hopeless social cycle, yet imbibed with verve, samba a-swinging do Brasil",ruby_fff,2 February 2003,8,"Yes, CITY OF GOD is an exuberantly sad story, with subtle faith, hope and love throughout. A bold stroke of genius to tell such a tale in this lively fashion - swift and steady, sad and comic, bullets flying, joyful dancing, pausing suspense - all the colors do Brasil."
A cruel portrait,eagandersongil,26 December 2019,9,"""City of God"" is an icon of Brazilian cinema, a film that breaks the standards and limits of its culture and reaches a level of few in Brazilian culture, ""City of God"" is a film of the highest visual, technical and artistic quality, A spectacular movie."
A dark descent into Brazilian ghetto struggles...,phoenixx100,20 August 2009,10,"Wow, what a darkly profound film. Really gets down into the nitty-gritty details of the street gangster life (at least as it was in decades past) in Brazilian slums. The subtle storyline shifts involving various characters throughout the film may be slightly confusing for some viewers, but the general focus is on Rocket (Buscapé), who wraps up the entire plot of the film nicely at the end. The plentiful violence is never gratuitous; it's always believable. Even when casual cruelty is depicted, it makes sense in the world of the story. In spite of the constant drug dealing shown throughout, it really makes your heart go out to the ghetto denizens of South America, and hope that things ultimately will change for the better there."
Awesome and Uncanny,loganx-2,12 June 2008,10,"There are a lot of films about kids in 3rd world conditions going down violent paths, but rarely are these accounts as first hand, expansive, and compelling as City Of God. There's a vibrancy, urgency, compassion, and scope that makes this movie so hard to pull away from. The story of a boy named Rocket trying to escape and being pulled back into the violent conditions around him, as well as the local history that created this environment. We see generations of slumlords few old enough to drive, come and go, in ages and empires, of drugs and fashions from the 60's to the 70's. Most of the performers here are not actors but children from the infamous slum, including Brazilian pop star Sue Jorge(seen in the Life Aquatic seeing David Bowie songs) who also grew up there. There's an immediacy, honesty, and energy to this film that 90 percent of films about gangsters, street life, and the 3rd world miss. No glorifications of excess, just poverty, desire, hope, and ignorance, put in a blender and set to f*^k all. Anyway, excellent from start to finish. One of my favorite films of all time."
The best!,cmapbh,3 December 2002,10,"City of God is a excellent movie! Fernando Meirelles did a perfect job in the direction, the characters are very touching and real. The story isn't fiction and its the best movie ever made about the war in the Brasilians slams. For the Brasilians, its a movie to open our eyes and see our reality, we really are in a war, but we try to not see. For the foreigners its a movie to show that Brasil isn't only samba, soccer and mulatas. Its violent, but if the reality is like that, its better don't hide!"
An Inspiration,kraljevic411,22 June 2015,8,"What I taught from this movie is that you need to believe in yourself and your success whatever the circumstances are. You may be surrounded by criminals and killers in a village where few got out, you may be called a loser and weak but as soon as you know it, you are an overall winner because you followed your dreams and actually made something of your life. Karma is unforgiving for the bad but it rewards the good in any which way. It's something everybody underestimates. As a European, I find it completely incomprehensible that people live this way. I judged them the complete movie and it's really hard to watch all of those lives get wasted for actually nothing but I guess it's something me and my culture (in general) can't realize. I found a connection with Rocket. He was a guy which was aside most of the time, has some friends but no enemies. I believe many innocent people like him get killed in favelas, which is frustrating, but surely you have much more chance in succeeding than gangsters and drug dealers. Anyway, an inspiring story, it was easy to watch as well even though a lot of people were involved in it."
The Cycle of Violence,JWick23,15 May 2022,,"One of the best international films I have ever seen. The directing and camera work is amazing, it was just so raw and authentic. The story was good with good themes as well as nicely written characters to support the story and great interactions between them. The set scenes were great and the visuals and sound were nice."
"Numbingly tragic yet gripping at the same time, City of God is an ugly tale beautifully displayed on screen",diac228,9 April 2008,10,"Sometimes in order to portray a harsh reality, one must embed vicious images into the minds of others, no matter how gruesome they may be. City of God is a ghastly movie full of things you thought you'd never see in a movie. What's even worse is how it's based off a true story. Even more terrifying then that is how the children in the movie for the most part have experience in the slums that are being portrayed. With kids being as skillful in murder as the average human being, City of God is a totally different look into the country of Brazil, one that you'd never see on the Travel Channel. Compared favorably to crime movies like Goodfellas, the only difference is in this narrative; you have no other choice but to be a gangster in the streets."
A little emotion,zzhhhqing,12 April 2020,10,"No more brutal growth and no more confusion in reflection is not a culprit collusion but was saved after the incident. Everything is reincarnation, or is it a good job as a troubled photographer."
The Absolute Best Crime Film Ever,Nerdboy1423,5 April 2006,10,"When I saw this film I felt it was almost too real. I couldn't separate the fact that this was cinema from how it affects me so realistically. I wasn't exploitative or needlessly violent like most crime films, but showed a city for what it truly is on the underbelly where age, gender, drugs, sex, race and money meet head on. The film is spectacular, every performance feels completely authentic the characters emotions are completely palpable. It's a disturbingly blunt and stylish view at a world we don't know but can't deny. A world we hate that exists yet are totally drawn towards. This film is better than any film made in America in the past 10 years, it belongs on the top #20 where it's at here, but it truthfully deserves a higher post. It's not only a great film, but it's has a conscience that is lacking from other crime films. The protagonist, Rocket, is the guiding light in this world of darkness, who leads us from temptation to temptation, mixing us in with these impoverished people and drug-fueled gangsters on a Homeric odyssey that has one of the most poetic and cynical endings I've ever witnessed. Not to be missed, if you haven't seen City of God, you are woefully missing out."
City of God (2002-03) - Brazilian translation: Cidade de Deus,nickmesafilms,9 September 2011,10,"""City of God"" (Cidade de Deus) is a foreign film that takes place in the slums of Rio de Janeiro. The story follows an underworld tale of organized crime in the City of God suburb, which involves criminals and drug dealers. I personally thought that the movie was rather excellent. The movie was provided by an excellent director named Fernando Meirelles, and he used a lot of charm to the movie. I also enjoyed the use of cinematography, film editing, transitions, and music. To show an example, the use of editing and transitions can play back a character's story, or in other words, the story goes back and forth to talk about a particular character. Also, the cinematography was used to draw the audience's attention with all the zooms, pans, and wides, putting us in the middle of everything. Finally, the acting provided by unprofessional actors was brilliant in every way, bringing tons of heart and drama into the characters. To me, I think of foreign movies are pieces of entertainment in a different country, which is still fun to watch. When I heard about the movie, I had no idea that it was actually a foreign film, but since I know now, I respected the movie for what it was. The overall look of the movie was brilliantly organized, and it made the audience feel like they are walking the streets of the City of God. How awesome is that? ""City of God"", in my review, ""a sudden miracle of a movie, with a piece of dynamite entertainment."""
A fantastic film with an otherwise depressing theme,kylemorrell,12 October 2020,10,I would say City of God is one of the better films I've watched in recent years.

Visceral Brilliance,gary-444,3 April 2009,8,"A wonderful film that succeeds in paying homage to the American gangster film genre whilst at the same time creating a distinct world all of its own.An unknown cast is brilliantly Directed by Fernando Meirelles to offer a stunning insight into the world of the slums in Brazil, and in particular The City of God."
Cinematic Heaven set in Hell,flingebunt,24 May 2004,,"American movies depicting violence have become very formulaic. So much so that the movies are protraying how violence in cinema works, not in real life."
Entertainment and enlightenment,guskeller,23 January 2022,9,"City of God is a sobering dive into economic neglect. In a slum of Rio de Janerio, City of God displays the cycle of violence and normalized crime that comes with extreme poverty. Its brutal honesty is shocking and revealing, creating an emotional whirlwind. Though upsetting, City of God's truthfulness makes it incredibly important. Plus, the film provides space for levity and relatability, diversifying the experience and deepening the heartbreak. Furthermore, the cast of the film is primarily from the area, so their acting is based on genuine experience. Thus, City of God is always authentic and as raw as possible."
The best new film to premiere in Cannes 2002.,mp65steady,26 May 2002,9,"My first reaction to this engrossing, thrilling, gutsy AND witty drama about ghetto life in Rio de Janeiro was: WOW! What a movie. It takes you for an unrivaled trip to the youth ghetto of Rio, the so-called ""City of God"". We follow the lives of some kids, who grow up in the late 60's - most of them don't live to experience the 80's. The only, or let's say: the fastest way to get out of these dumps are violence and drugs. Using violence and pushing drugs. You better not mess that order up, or you're done. While debutant Fernando Meirelles shows the incidents in ultra-realistic (and therefore mind-numbingly brutal) fashion, he nevertheless achieves great art by splicing up the story, going from the present to the past, using newest technology wisely, speeding up the tempo with great ease, but also slowing down whenever he has to and showing the ability to be tender. He teases the audience with hints about things to come, and when he gets back to those things, he always delivers in a big way. The film has about a dozen important characters, and it's amazing how Meirelles not only manages to introduce them with style, but also keeps track of them so that we always know who we are dealing with."
Relentless misery.,WalterFrith,27 February 2004,,"You know, I love crime movies.  Even the low brow stuff which is sometimes hard to watch.  Some people are driven to a life of crime by several factors of society.  Child abuse, poverty, unemployment, over taxation, racism and other injustices and society is just as culpable as the criminals it produces."
CRUSHINGLY good!!!!,smakawhat,25 January 2003,9,"This film is breathtaking, yet it does get slow in a few places. Nevertheless, it is a film that is incredibly eye opening for this country of Brasil and its culture of violence in the favelas (slums)."
You can neither hide nor run and you eventually end up getting caught,iamnobody,30 July 2005,10,"Another movie with one of the characters narrating the story.In this case a real life story. The direction is just perfect. If he had just shown it as a single long story it wouldn't have been that effective. Breaking up the whole story and connecting them from one to an other was a perfect idea which worked out perfectly well. About the movie , city of god as i cud perceive it was mainly a city of blacks where violence is at its peak. Gangsters,Drugs,Deaths,Gunshots are pretty common for the people living in the city of god. Maybe this sounds common as we see this in many movies, but what is uncommon is that a person burying his alive wife, a young boy killing all the people in a motel, small boys who can hardly speak roaming around with guns etc. Part of the story is based on revenge. Everything for just the desire of a person to become the boss of hoodlums. An excellent movie with a strong story and perfect depiction of reality."
"As they say, ""And now the film....""",B24,13 June 2004,9,"I have waited for some time to view the dvd from Netflix, and when it finally arrived this week I watched it with great interest.  Previously, I had read some of the reviews and in fact discussed the film last week with a really bright Brazilian kid as he shined my shoes in a big Washington hotel. Hardly an objective lead up to actually seeing and reviewing the film, but since another Imdb subscriber recently took me to task (lamely, it must be noted) for being unoriginal, I wanted to provide a full disclaimer."
Blood and Mud Masterpiece,Dockelektro,30 March 2003,10,"Never in the history of cinema the favelas assumed the real place they earned as a melting pot of cinematic value. Ultimately, Fernando Meirelles understood that it was time to fill the gap, and, corageously, moved forward into the excruciating experience that would be the making of a movie about them. When you see this movie, you'll thank him in silence. Because Meirelles' movie grabs this world-within-a-world with rare boldness, and makes it much more than a simple ""south american goodfellas"" like someone called it. ""Cidade de Deus"" is a view-changing experience, for it is the first time the audience leaps deep into the schemes, the violence, the blood and the mud. And your vision of the street gang violence in Rio de Janeiro will never be the same. Magnificently acted (and don't forget these were all people from the real ghetto), brilliantly framed and graspingly edited, this movie's real triumph is letting us know what goes inside the places we never dare to get into. And succeeds in doing so with the touch of genius. With immense production values, it is amazing how the movie never gets too heavy or too epic, and you'll marvel at the way realism is the motto here, while the film never has pretentions of becoming a mockumentary. This movie's got heart, and real guts. And it ends up becoming the film about the favelas no one ever dared to do. So you'll thank director Meirelles - rarely there has been such courage from a movie maker."

"Okay movie, but not a masterpiece like the reviews make it out to be.",halliejopo,20 October 2013,5,"City of God is one of the highest rated movies here on IMDb, which has me ask the question: why? Yes, it has some intense scenes, endearing acting, and interesting usage of camera angles, but other than that, City of God is unremarkable."
A top film that I will never forget! Amazingly constructed,jimmy_james777,25 August 2012,10,"This movie was intense! I loved it as it really showed the reality of what happens in the slums of these places. It was full on, kept me hooked, it was brutal, no holds barred and it was a fantastic film that shined a light on what really happens in isolated, war ravaged countries. The structuring of time blew me away, although it may be confusing to some people, it was simply genius to me. The 'true story' effect made it even more engaging to me."
So Close to a 10,dallasryan,3 November 2012,9,"All I can say about this movie is you are in for a treat, this is a wild blood bath with a great story, and some fantastic acting. It has a rated R rating which is tough to believe, I would have thought easily NC-17 but nonetheless, the Academy Voters would never nominate a film like this for best film, which is unfortunate."
Intense,Monellifilms,15 December 2008,9,"City of God is like Shakespeare. A powerful movie that takes us through the world of drugs in Rio de Janeiro. The film is full of rich characters, and an even richer story (or stories). Fate and chance occur throughout the film, letting you decide what is it really."
Needs an editor,teddyryan,23 June 2004,,"CITY OF GOD is a bit self-indulgent, a film that shuns on the gangster lifestyle yet always eager to promote it.  Martin Scorsese and Tarantino's influences run heavy in this nearly 3 minute saga about life in the slums of Rio De Janero.  As a result, it's hard to enjoy the subject matter as you're hit over the head with garish displays of a filmmaker gone wild. Nonetheless, the performances are top notch.  A group of unknowns perfectly execute the instability of teenagers with access to guns, drugs and money. In one instance, a gruesome scene seems so real, you want to turn your head. Still, I stuck with the main character throughout the picture, a sign that the screenwriter had done his homework when taking on such a daunting adaptation."
"One of the best movies ever, IMHO",claudiano,1 October 2002,10,"One of the best movies EVER, in my opinion."
Don't believe the hype..,alhazmi-82655,15 June 2022,5,"It's overrated, the cinematography is unique and intense, but the plot is messy and the dialogues are boring.. many scenes are nonsense and the characters had so much potential.. like why on earth Rocket didn't react when his gf cheated on him.. LIKE NOTHING! And why did Knockout Ned died in a stupid way/ they killed his family ffs, why didn't he avenge them? What's the point of him being in the plot? He saw his family dying and participated with Carrot, and now we have a climax but a stupid kid kills him? THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST ENDINGS IN CINEMA..and Lil Z dies easily like that? We didn't see him suffer, we didn't see him begging for his life.. I don't know.. I think this movie had so much potential but it didn't deliver.."
Brilliant Filmmaking; A Must-Watch for Avid Movie Lovers !!,akash_sebastian,3 October 2011,9,"One of the best movies ever made, based on a real story. The skillfully & brilliantly written screenplay, accompanied by the excellent cinematography, editing and direction, makes the movie a well-paced & interesting watch. The acting is convincing too. The background score goes quite well with the theme; it gives us a feel of the ghetto and prevents the movie from being too grim."
A wonderful film that opens up a window to the gang violence in favela outside of Rio de Janeiro,chisingtse,7 April 2007,10,"The movie is very well put together and it offers viewers (especially for international audience) a close look to the daily challenges that favela residents (mostly displaced people) have to face outside of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil."
A fascinating snapshot of urban and social disintegration,galileo3,1 February 2008,7,City Of God (2003)
A difficult to watch but very IMPORTANT movie to see,Bob Pr.,8 October 2010,9,"We chose this movie for our monthly ""Great Films"" series. It's accurately rated ""R"" for violence, gutter language, drugs, & sex. (One viewer left 1/4 way through because of this.) Roger Ebert said, ""This is one of the best films you will EVER see."""
"City of ""Awesome""!",shivam_s88,8 October 2009,9,"Foreign Cinema at its best! This movie is so strong, so hard hitting, it's able to leave a very strong mark in your memory, which is the best compliment for any movie. Cidade De Deus was on my list for a very long time, but it takes me a lot of time before I brace myself to start a movie with subtitles, but I'm glad I finally saw it! Based on a true story, set in Brazil, movie covers every essence of a ""Drug movie"", violence, sex, blood, and the extra topping in this one, Children Gangsters. If you thought you saw it all about Children holding guns in Blood Diamond then watch this, it'll definitely prove you wrong. With all the bloodshed and gore, movie does have some really heart wrenching moments as well. The cinematography of this movie took me aback! Especially while introducing new characters, and adding extra angle to the story, brilliant! Same goes out for the performances by every single character in the movie. The only glitch was the movie feels a lil dragged and I was starting to feel the movie is overrated, but just as you start to feel that, BOOM, it picks up the pace! Look out for the kid who portrays young Lil' Dice, one of the finest performances by a child artist I've ever come across. This is a must watch for everyone, especially for those who thought Slumdog Millionaire was the best movie to be shot in slums. Time to discover underbelly of Brazil, real dark!"
"The harsh , brutal , cold reality",shadowman123,28 December 2006,9,"Brazil is a huge, vast country with enormous amounts of history and culture but having said that would you believe that only 10% of the population own 80% of its wealth? City Of God shows us what you could say is the hidden side of Brazil away from its glittery night life and laid back attitude, it is a cold, hard knock to the head which shows that the words 'Life is Cheap' live up to its expectations. The tag line of the movie is Fight and you won't survive , run and you won't escape and it could not be more closer to that as the movie shows us the life of kids/teens growing up in the slums of Rio De Janerio. Don't mistake this for a hyped up ghetto and glamorising gun-totting movie! City of God is a pure , raw side of life in the harsh slums of Rio where truly only the strong survive . The main character if you may is a guy called Rocket who just like any other teen dreams of the better things in life i.e. a good job , house , babes ! But always finds him-self down on his luck as he can never truly escape the dangers and problems that he faces growing up (as if being a teen is not tough enough!) The movie is then played out in a Pulp Fiction format showing the lives of the people around him and like him all of them have hopes and dreams but are all sucked into the harsh void of reality . The acting was top-notch all round and the direction of the movie just made you want more but to some it up in general City of God is an experiment with the truth which makes the likes of Snopp Dogg and 50 cent look like a bunch of playground bullies as it holds nothing back in showing the life faced living in Rio's slums and to what extend people will go to , to get what they want from life when circumstances don't give the basic things we take for granted in our lives. A powerful film and pleasure to watch."
Scarface goes to Rio.,Shiva-11,2 February 2003,,"When life gives you lemons, make lemonade.  When life gives you nothing, you do what you can.  For the inhabitants of Cidade de Deus  (the City of God) one of the most notorious favelas (slums) outside of Rio de Janeiro that often means relying on crime to survive.  The inhabitants' problems are exacerbated by indiscriminate gun battles waged by gangs trying to control the drug trade, and cops whose interrogation techniques consist of shooting first and beating confessions out of the survivors."
Lives up to the hype and so much more,tennis-hero,20 August 2009,10,"This is the story of one guy, who lived in some poor slum."
Great Rental Movie Along the Lines of 'American History X',heisenberg12,8 August 2017,8,"This is a great rental movie similar to American History X. Both were movies I didn't expect much of, but the narratives become so engrossing, you're surprised you hadn't heard more praise about them. They both ride tightly spun narratives and culminate with satisfying climaxes. If you haven't seen it, this is a great movie to rent and better ultimately than you'd expect."
A phenomenal coming of age story. A very authentic and genuine movie.,MrPupkin,22 October 2019,9,"Dark, disturbing, powerful, and often funny, City of God is a totally immersive tale, complimented by naturalistic performances and inventive, almost Guy Ritchie-esque camera work. It can be a little bit difficult to follow who exactly is who among the huge roster of characters, but fortunately their colorful names and fleshed out personalities help keep them straight."
Dark City,krational66,2 April 2020,9,"The city of God abandoned by God a city that is ubiquitous except for theft,rape,smuggling,drug trafficking,murder,robbery,because there is no need to steal here, and most of the crimes are underage children. This is true he'll and where humanity annihilates. Superb editing, rich plots, and suitable soundtracks make up a very good film. What is even more shocking is tha this film is based on a True story"
Why people love this movie,K-nightt,7 June 2007,9,"I may be wrong (I'm not), but I imagine that most of IMDb's audience is composed of prepubescent, middle- to upper-middle class mamas-boys who hide behind the incognito status in an ill-conceived attempt to seem tough. And that's fine, and yes I have a point. People like you need this movie to be based on the truth, you're so warped in your overprotected, sterile life in a ridiculously puritan culture that this kind of intangible reality is all you have left to keep you from offing your fellow virgin colleagues at school. What else is a major factor in this unconditional love for having other people live a life of misery and violence? Ignorance (deep...). The stupider the person, the more one-dimensional their outlook is on foreign culture. They think Africa, their minds rush off to a malnourished Somali child with a hood over his head in a refugee camp... nothing else matters to them, that's Africa and that's final. Now, think Brazil... samba, Pele, Rio, poverty, violence, drugs... and all that noise. That's all this country is... nobody can walk the streets without being ransacked by a half-dozen monkey boys who will take your money, rape you and thrash you to within an inch of your life. All women are prostitutes, all people do all day is watch reruns of Pele's soccer matches and dance to Carnival music. Now, I've lived in Brazil for some 18 years, 2 of them in São Paulo, I've been to Rio, and I currently reside in one of the wealthier cities in the country (wealth in Brazil?? he must mean he owns a lot of soccer-playing prostitutes). I've never been mugged (what?? you just said you went to Rio!!). This city is overrun by BMW's, high-powered executives, and a ridiculously high standard of living, you rarely see a beggar walking the streets... by the way, I live in Brazil. Now, if you're as retarded as I imagine you are, you're there with a pathetic smirk on your acne-ridden face going ""well la-di-da for you"". I want you to mock me, because by doing so you're confessing to being a moron. Now, about the movie. I loved it... it's great micro-nonfiction that summarizes in a very stylized manner an issue going on in the ostracized portions of society, the portions that some people need to live in pain in order to feel better about themselves (yes, you..). Now, what's the problem with it? It echoes the stereotype the American society embraces as supreme regarding life outside their fortress, and the fact that the director is Brazilian furthers this stupidity. I'm not going to waste my time lecturing potential viewers, everyone has their head cemented miles up their own a*s, inertia is a major lifestyle, self-indulgence is the most pragmatic of dogmas that you people perpetrate on yourselves, your opinion is an absolute truth, no matter how much of it is based on creative coloring-in of the proverbial blanks (in most cases, a blank sheet). Not to worry, as long as you stay tucked within your make-believe world, nothing will harm you... be safe, the world never was any bigger than you wanted it to be; blame your parents for that, they activated the self-destruct button in your brain long before you were born."
Just really an average gang movie,ickko,15 March 2007,6,"I cannot say it is a bad movie. Actually it is one of the best i have seen lately... I went to the movies when the movie first came to my country, I didn't like it very much. Yesterday I wanted to see it again, because may be i couldn't understand it when i was 16 or 17 when i first saw it. I played the DVD tonight, and yes, i really hadn't catch quite the movie 5 years ago. Now I did, but that doesn't made me love it. Yes, the story was quite original and the director did a good job, but in my opinion this isn't enough for a movie to qualify in the top 20 of the greatest movies here... Leandro Firmino(Li'l Ze) performs great and deserves a high praise, but can it really compare to the performance of, for example, Al Pacino in Heat (160 positions under City of God in Top250). This is ridiculous. It is quite unfair that foreign language movies are rated so high, just because they are not American. I really don't mean to offend anyone. I still think the movie is good, but still cannot compare to much more valuable movies which even didn't make it to the top250. As I already said it is just an average gangster movie. And please don't judge my opinion, cause everyone has the right to like or not like a movie, no matter if it is in the top20..."
Extreme Poverty + the Cycle of Violence,ACollegeStudent,10 December 2022,7,Rating: 7.7
Not a very good movie too.,drmuhammedsamiduru,15 April 2020,5,"It is a beautiful movie, but the erotic scenes in the movie overshadowed the subject of the movie."
A story that entertains you in every way.,manendra-lodhi,31 May 2012,10,The thing that gets in to my mind just after watching the film is that please god save me from a city like this. The film is a pure fun. It is fast paced(most important thing.). It is thrilling. It is exciting. Everything in it is something that you will like for sure. Children are amazing. You would never have seen children so fearless as in this city. There are a lot of elements of surprise that will glue you to the seat. But there are instances where you will think as to what stupidity is this. But I say just enjoy the film with the point in your mind as if there is a city like this also in this world. I am not a technical expert but the cinematography in the film definitely noticeable. The editing is another thing that I happened to notice. No wonder it was nominated for the best edited feature.
A bit messy but well crafted,griffithxjohnson,8 November 2022,7,"Powerful & compelling. The tones are all over the place but crate something unique. It's dark, hopeful, & funny with awesome camerawork. It's dated but still accomplishes its goals. The pacing is both a positive & a negative."
"Unnecessary disturbing scenes, only desensitize people can stomach this movie,",kgav-20022,5 November 2017,1,"I watched by accident, it seemed like a great idea to tell an story as it is. Acting was very good. But there is too much graphic extreme violence towards little children. I would never watch again and the fact it has so many awards only shows how desensitize our society is. Stay away from this movie."
Welcome to the Brazilian Ghetto,karl_consiglio,6 May 2006,8,"Loosely based on real events and set in the slums of Rio de Janeiro, City of God has a lot in common in the scarcely believable 'Scarface'. It too traces the rise of a psychotic coke lord and has its share of drugs, guns, gang warfare, horrifying violence, sex, memorable characters, more guns, some sociological points that don't have to be concentrated on too hard to grasp, and more drugs. Ultimately City of God is more exciting than Scarface, more colourful and ultimately more brutal and depressing. Not least because the killers in this film are very young-as often as not, just children. And it is all the more chilling because many of the kids are played by non professionals from the poorer parts of Rio. The narrator is Rocket, who is growing up in Cidade de Deus, a sink estate on the edge of Rio, a place where baiting the police is a way of life, every child is destined to be a thug and making it past 18 years old is a real bonus. The toughest kid in Rockets neighbourhood is Little Ze and, as they reach their teens, Ze embarks on a reign of terror when his killer instinct helps coke them over from grass as one of the few commodities Rio's poor can sell its rich. City Of God's chief success is in pulling off a crucial balancing act. It manages to survey a world that is wild and thrilling and full of great music and good parties, but never lets up on the fact that it's also a death trap where eight year olds tout semi-automatics and friendship counts for nothing. A lot more than a cheap holiday in someone else's misery. Anyone who ever chanced to watch MTV's cribs or Hello magazine's At Home With The Stars kind of stuff-will have noticed that all rappers, nu-metallers and pop punks feel obliged to own the DVD of Scarface blood soaked tale of guns and coke dealing and claim that its the best movie of the sort ever made. Maybe, just maybe, some of them will find shelf space for City OF God."
Okayish.,riddhimaakaritu,25 September 2020,5,On technical level I could see that this is a good film. And when I realized it is based on true story it made it so tragic. Kids with guns is one of the most upsetting site.
A Ruddy Bloody good film,oneflewovertheapocalypse,14 September 2003,,Has anybody ever heard of the band At the Drive In because Benny in City of God looks just like the lead guitarist from that band and Mars Volta.  I thought I'd just share that with everyone.
outstanding low budget masterpiece,elkaz6,13 August 2004,,"This is a great movie. Made with a very low budget. A movie that made Tom Hanks say he was in awe of. Outstanding. Touching. A movie also about hope. But I'd like first to address the two bad comments out of the over 300 in the board. One gentleman complains about the subtitles. Well, it really is frustrating to see in this day and age this kind of comment. It is so revolting to hear this sort of statement. Everybody else in the world when they watch American movies watch them with subtitles. But there is an anti intellectual bent in America (quite ethnocentric) in which movies made in other languages have to be dubbed to obtain any kind of box office success. To this gentleman I'd like to say that the Iliad, The Odyssey, the Bible, Crime and Punishment, 7th Seal, and many other works of art were not done by Americans. Yet we all enjoy them. So I'd encourage him to expand his mind and enroll in a Spanish 101 class in the local community college. Specially considering that the idea behind the global market of ideas is if we want to be heard we must hear others. This sort of dumb a** bs I read on these boards just p** me off. If you are an idiot without any kind of appreciation of what's good and beautiful stick to War Bus and Beach Babes from Beyond. If you don't like a movie because it is in another language don't watch any foreign films! (stay ignorant about the world) rather than watching a movie and giving it a bad review because it was not in English. There is another cat calls himself webmaster 49. The guy gives every movie he reviews a bad rating (including The Pianist, Chinatown, Taxi Driver). But he gives Mr. Goodbar an outstanding review calls it one of the best movies of the 70s. Dead man walking he also praises. So don't be tricked by these two. Their sense of aesthetics cannot be defended with any sort of rational argument. Don't be fooled by them. This is an outstanding movie."
Wonderful film!,lotus_chief,29 February 2004,9,**POSSIBLE SPOILERS**
"Good movie, but far from original and has been done many times in the past",marc5477,12 March 2017,7,"Its a fictional story about a kid who wants to become a photographer and grew up in the slums of Brazil. The story is told like a documentary with the main character playing narrator and talking about his experience in the slums known as the ""City of God."" We follow the lives of himself as well as friends and adversaries from childhood to adulthood. The movie does a good job of conveying how hopeless life can be in certain parts of the world and that sometimes there are no options for those living in such conditions (unless they get extremely lucky like the main character)."
amazing! Brilliant! Realistic! Stylish!,MovieLoonie,18 October 2005,10,"A surprising find! One of the greatest films I have ever seen. Can be brutally real and shocking at times. Wonderfully stylized film in the stringing together of several stories that revolve around the main character. The fact that it is a true story is absolutely mind-blowing. Great writing, great cinematography, great stylistic directing, but not so stylistic that it seems not real or plastic. Still maintains its integrity. Great acting. The movie has nice quiet moments and shocking edge of your seat tension! Really a must see for any real movie lover. You won't be disappointed. I'm glad I bought it. You'll want to watch it more than once!"
"Jolting, epic and powerful (***1/2)",Ronin47,20 October 2003,9,"The City Of God is a housing project in Brazil just outside of lush Rio de Janeiro that, to put it plainly, makes South Central L.A. look like a walk in the park.  Drugs and guns are a fact of life, dead bodies lie in the streets and kids barely into their double-digits carry machine guns."
...,lagriff05,2 August 2008,10,"Well, I've been wanting to see this for a long time, and it did not disappoint - to put it lightly. Gritty, snappy, charismatic and even beautiful, this movie hits you, the viewer, in all the right places. Indeed, this is based on a real story, and it is also in Spanish with subtitles, but all that just serves to the purpose of assuring that City of God is as realistic and jarring as possible."
Incredible Film,MichaelMRamey,29 July 2019,10,"This film not only has a fascinating story, but it is an incredibly well made. The way the story is told - meeting characters who are important to the plot, yet you don't know that until later when it is all tied together. The shots are gorgeous and I was wowed by many of the camera transitions throughout; especially the cut between Lil Ze to Steak to Carrot. As for the entertainment factor and story of City Of God it has a powerful message of corruption and the lengths people will go to, to survive in the never ending cycle of crime and poverty within the City. Some of the scenes are hard to watch as it feels like your watching a documentary instead of a film, but it keeps you on the edge of your seat and engaged for the entire run time. I would recommend this film to anyone whether you're a film nerd, filmmaker or just casual viewer."
Impressive but irresponsible,mtsai-2,2 February 2003,1,"Imagine what it would have been like if Tarantino made a film about the D.C. area sniper shootings, then you'll get ""City of God"" - a sensational, cold and calculated stylistic exercise based on compelling real-life human drama. The story of the kids involving in the drug trade turf wars is an extraordinary one, but somehow the filmmaker has managed to reduce it to a showcase of his cinematic bag of tricks. This film has left me completely cold, and disgusted by the filmmaker's intentions."
You will thank your life after watching this,priyantha-bandara,12 December 2010,10,"'City of God' also known as Cidade de Deus is not just an ordinary foreign language film. It is one of those 'the' movies out of the several which I have seeing related to gangsters and drugs. I may call it the Brazil version of the 'Godfather' or 'Slum Dog Millionaire' not just for its style of storytelling or the mere similarities in the plot, but for how great those movies were. What's bonus for 'City of God' out of all is that it's based on true events. And realizing that such incidences have taken place and such societies exist is a good enough reason for you to be thankful for your life what you enjoy."
Once upon a time in Rio,deastman_uk,13 January 2003,10,I'm not sure why this fim is compared with Goodfellas - it is a somewhat better film than that. The true comparsion is with the more epic films.
City of God,RickHarvey,17 September 2010,7,"First of all , this film look beautiful and really captures essence of the slums of Brazil. The pacing is fast, not one scene drags. You can't help but think that this film ripped a massive page on narrative off Goodfellas's book. It also takes some notes from Pulp fiction."
this film is based on a true story,f-57307,27 March 2020,9,"""A city abandoned by God."" A city everywhere except for theft, rape, smuggling, drug trafficking, killing, robbery, because there is no need for theft here, and most of the crimes are underage children. This is the place where real hell and humanity annihilate. The superb editing, rich plot and suitable soundtrack make up a very good film. What is even more shocking is that this film is based on a true story."
Good film with subtitles,info-211-811284,13 January 2015,,Have watched this film 4 or 5 times now and still doesn't get boring. Shows you how life is lived on the streets of Rio and is pretty real life from the way the camera tells the story. From what i have read a lot of the actors and actresses were not know as the director wanted to tell the story of real life people from the ghettos. The story has some great twists and turns and a lot of great action scenes. The gang of children that stick together as a family and the way the robbed and stole together brought to life what they must have to go through in real life.
Top tier entertaintment.,aichusla,2 May 2018,10,Fascinating insight into the uncompromising violent dark side!
"Watch this and then try to complain about your ""first-world problems.""",SeriousJest,2 July 2014,10,"I kept hearing that this movie was good, but I never got around to watching it. Having glanced at its cover before, I was expecting something differentmore of a sappy romantic tale. Instead, I discovered one of most poignant, suspenseful, exciting, and action-packed tales of a place that I've only heard stories about. It catapulted me through a wide range of emotions. Watch this and then try to complain about your ""first-world problems."" The City of God is shockingly poor and frighteningly dangerous, yet culturally rich and unexpectedly beautiful."
The greatest foreign film I've seen,cobizer,2 August 2005,10,"When a friend recommended I watch this movie, I wasn't all that excited. Subtitles? Call me when the dubbed version comes out. Against my will I watched this Brazilian flick anyway and was pleasantly surprised. The cinematography alone in this movie is worth watching it. Even if you are not interested in violence, Brazil, or (gasp!) subtitles, the camera angles, lighting, and innovative use of handy cams are stunning. The movie has a real documentary feeling to it and features characters that you actually care about. There was not one death that occurred in this movie that came as a relief. I was actually emotionally attached to all of them. (Even the ones that may have deserved a violent death.) To top it all off, the story is extremely complicated and in-depth but is told so well that it is never confusing. Go buy this movie, it's too epic for a rental!"
long and boring movie,qqml,23 December 2020,6,"The movie just tell one things, drug dealers fight each other inside slum near Rio Brazil."
One of the slickest movies you'll ever see,wandereramor,29 March 2012,9,"A mixture of Tarantino-esque narrative play, a fast-paced plot, and the talented direction of Meirelles and Lund make this an intoxicating crime drama that's almost impossible to stop watching. It's a movie about cyclical violence and the degradation of poverty in Brazil, but for all that it's fun to watch -- the characters are catchy if not particularly deep, and the crime is aesthetically pleasing at the same time as it never lets us forget the horror and evil of the violence we're watching."
The best Brazilian movie ever made !,vitorpiovezam,17 December 2016,10,"A film that portrays the life of the poor Brazilian class, mainly from Rio de Janeiro, portrayed by locals themselves, amateur actors and did a great job, many revealed to the great Brazilian entertainment industry. The film has excellent direction, fantastic subjective elements, and time does not continue in a single line, the director approaches different moments in different times of the film. Amazing. This film was a great revolution in Brazilian cinema, it was nominated for international awards, which for the Brazilian film industry was new.A great film to know the reality of the poor class, and the history of the city of God, favela of the rio."
The most grotesquely violent movie I've ever seen!!!,jmvscotland,18 December 2015,7,"If the director's aim in making this movie was to make the most grotesquely violent and repellent movie in the history of cinema, then I think he's probably cracked it. This is a train wreck of a movie, one that at the same repels and engages the audience; well, that's what it did for me anyway. Certainly, there's a Hell of a film-making talent here and the end result is truly, and sadly, unforgettable. I can't say I enjoyed seeing this movie but technically it does have great merit. And, having sat through this movie, now I know that the very last place in the whole world that I would like to see at first hand is this slum outside Rio. I've never had any great desire to go to Brazil or to any of its major cities despite having traveled widely. Now I know for sure that I can give Rio a miss, especially after hearing from a good friend that he was robbed at knife-point on Copacabana beach some years ago. The movie gets 7 out of 10 and Brazil gets zero."
"Honest, unbelievable, impossible to turn away from.",CaterpillarEffect,18 January 2010,9,"A film based on facts. A story of crime in the City of God outside of Rio de Janeiro. Drug-related crime in which young people and children are heavily involved. To show it in a film format is not easy, especially since the book is very complex. And making that film truly fantastic is even harder. But it has been done."
"Great film, very funny in parts and not a 'liberal' sermon",RolyUK,14 November 2006,9,"Really loved this film, telling the story of the housing projects of Rio from their inception in the 60s to the end of the 70s through the eyes of a few of its major characters."
Easily one of the greatest gangster movies to ever do it,jimniexperience,8 January 2018,10,Based on a true story
One Of The Best Movies Ever,thornswrath,9 November 2004,,"Few films I have ever seen have managed to capture the essence of society's oft-lamented yet never-resolved problems of illegal drug trafficking and the rampant street crime as depicted in the City Of God in Brazil, as shown to us through the remarkably unskewed viewpoint of its many colorful real-life street characters. Of course the street-urchins recruited to play the roles of certain individuals now scattered in time have become first-time actors as a result of this astounding motion picture, and the characters they portray are brought to vivid, realistic life on the big screen in a manner that will captivate audiences from beginning to end, despite its rather long running time. (__-?) The process of sitting through this depiction of inner-slum street gangs and how one generation picks up the business of the older one that leaves it behind for them, is nothing short of revelatory. I thoroughly enjoyed Scorcese's Gangs Of New York, but I will say this: City Of God makes GONY look out to be but child's play. For one thing, Fernando Meirelles utilizes a nonfiction canvas with which to illustrate certain points that Scorcese utilized fictional conventions to get across. In Scorcese's depiction of violence, we are nearly saturated with violence almost for the sake of violence, a sort of hyped-up ultra violence that drives these kinds of gangster-pics, and which might very well repel a certain demographic of viewers who just don't care for that sort of aesthetic. In Meirelles stark and up-close depiction of the real-life dangerous goings-on of certain groups of street gangs, the violence carries with it the reflection of truth, and despite even being possibly more extreme, it can be accepted more as a fact of life or somehow manages to become easier to digest, if not flinch away from. CoG makes GoNY look like child's play, and that's ironic seeing as how it is children which take up the mantle and carry on the business which the older generation leaves for them. I walked out of City Of God a changed man - a refreshed man, that is, because it reminds you just how stark and real this whole business of the natural order of things is. And conversely, just how real the whole nature of the order of business is. Sit down behind the camera lens and allow yourself to be transformed as our young true hero guides you through this City Of God and shows you just how comfortably you sit there in the theatre contemplating it. Do not miss this transcendental film. Open your eyes and see through the lens of a child. Watch how this child grows up and passes through the necessary rituals to become a man. Ask yourself what it is this man has shown you through his eyes. And do not close your eyes to what is going on around you ever again."
What Great Filmmaking is all about,alexduffy2000,5 February 2004,,"I went to see ""City of God"" simply because it had gotten 4 oscar nominations (I write this 3 weeks before Oscar time).  I didn't know what it was about. A sappy Brazilian romance?  A religious film?"
Contrast,w-71474,25 April 2020,9,"The better the music, the crueler the story. This is a contrast"
One For The Millennium,gcrokus,5 September 2004,,"'City of God' should and will be at the top of any list of movies for film courses from the New Millennium for many years to come. In terms of thematic development, political commentary, social importance, technical mastery and sheer energy it really has no equal since 2000. This is truly a mesmerizing piece, in which the events of many years are compressed into a few hours; like the early scene of the boy spinning about in a grievously perilous tight spot, we are left whirling when we exit the theater."
My all-time favourite film... and I mean it!,ianmitchell-45214,7 April 2015,9,I think I have watched this film several times by now and I'll probably watch it several times more in my lifetime. I'm not the kind of person who watches films more than once. If I remember what happens I don't need to see it again.
Pulp Fiction Style Documentary,sacredmonk,15 May 2007,8,"First off, there are a few grievances I have with this film. It's sort of made in a way where it's kind of spread into chapters. Sort of like pulp fictions is made into chapters, depicting the story of several different people and events, so too is this film. I don't think this adds anything to the film, since you'll probably end up confused by the number of people anyway. There are a bit of characters, and trying to follow the story of each one may be bit confusing. The film is also narrated by the main character. In essence he gives you a tour of the ongoings of the City of God. In a way, it sort of feels like you are being shown a documentary about a city, rather than being given a movie to view. The documentary style, though informative, seems to be a bit over used, and removes the no-documentary movie feeling. That being said however, the film is good for the story, and depiction of the struggles of both the city and the many characters of the film. The corruption, sorrow, anger, greed, love, and joy are all expressed very clearly, and the film allows you to fully understand these feelings in the characters (once you get them all straightened out). I realize that following only the main characters story line would have drastically crippled the film, and would not have been able to illustrate every other characters story. Because of this it is essential that there are very many characters in the film. Understanding this, it is difficult to lower the movies rating based on there being too many characters to distinguish, as it is necessary for the story line. All in all, this film is above average, however an 8 out of ten may be a little bit generous. A 7.6 would be more accurate. Watch it if you have an opportunity to, but don't go out of your way to."
Brazilian Gangster movie lacks humanity,PurityofEssence100,6 October 2002,6,Once again an entrepreneur has managed to turn the misery of
"Blood, brothers and Brazil- A Masterpiece",nagsaptarshi,20 April 2020,9,"This is not your regular Mills and Boon story. So be cautioned if you are planning to watch this movie. The way people are gunned down in the movie, you might wonder if even chickens are slaughtered in that way or not. And probably that is the reason , the movie starts with a chicken slaughter.But this is the truest depiction of Brazil in that period. The lawlessness prevailing due to a callous Government regime, the fearlessness of the people due to a corrupt police system, growing addiction of the young generation, lack of education everything has been portrayed in an impartial manner. The hard hitting dialogues, the impassioned ambitions, the rise and fall of the gangsters everything is so credible.You are not going to be bored for a single moment in the movie even though the run-time is over two hours.Those who have beautiful fantasies of the streets of Rio, the voluptuous samba dancers, soccer skills of the youngsters may be shocked to see the harsh realities of life. The film is based on a true story and every detail of the story has been depicted in a documentary style, making it even more enjoyable for those who want to experience the life and cultures of the land of Samba. Overall a must watch for those craving for high quality cinematic experience.No wonder this is regarded as one of the finest movies of all time."
Peace is an eternal theme,Mnemosyne15,15 March 2020,9,"In a place where there is no good, you can survive by evil and even get a good life, but you can't always maintain your full security, and one day you will be replaced by new violent elements. The children who were struggling underneath originally, through their own efforts, integrated into the new environment and escaped from that poor ""city of God"", so that you can have a chance to be born again, integrate into a new civilization and system, and rely on normal methods Survive yourself, and strive to get your own expectations. In a society without a legal system, the bad means of survival are unimaginable, cruel and hard. However, no matter how hard you try, it may be impossible. Even if the scenery is beautiful in the morning, it will be in the dirt in the afternoon. Therefore, we should also strive to leave the uncivilized environment and enter the system of modern civilization, even if it is difficult at the beginning, but keep the security and long-term possible upward development possibility."
Amazing visual tour de force with real substance,Michael Kenmore,16 March 2003,10,"I went to see this film with the expectation as low as possible not giving the hype of City of God mind, and I walked away stunned."
Pace and Violence,Popey-6,13 June 2003,6,"If you looking for roughly sketched characters then this is your film. Like the film itself the central protagonists survive only on pace and violence. Unexpectedly unbloody, City of God's main saviour is its reliance on flashback and quirky narrative that owes much more to early Hollywood gangster flicks of the Bogart era than the Scorsese style many critics enthuse about. Worth a look - you'll certainly be kept on your toes."
A True Story Very Well Told,jcanettis,20 February 2004,9,"When I decided to watch ""Cidade de Deus"", I was rather hesitant. Although I had heard positive comments for the film, there were several things that were putting me off: The shoot-em-up story did not sound original, the actors were amateur, the language and location were not so familiar. However I devided to give it a try."
Stunning performances and storyline,r-j-b08,11 July 2009,10,"Cidade de Deus (City of God) is one of my favourite films ever. The acting is very well executed and the storyline is stylish, original and great. The camera work is interesting and superb. If you haven't seen it, see it. But for the full effect I find it's nicer to watch it in Portugese with subtitles. My mini parents guide (below) contains possible spoilers. It works on a 1 to 5 basis, 1 being soft, 3 being mild and 5 being extreme."
Remarkable,robertvannsmith,16 April 2003,,"I am a fan of Brazilian movies, so I thought I would give this one a try."
"Better than every other film ever made ever, so there...",thomas-hardcastle-2,12 June 2008,10,"This has to be amongst the greatest films ever made. It is funny, sad, frightening, gripping, suspenseful, and entertaining."
City of God Review,christianbmietus,16 October 2017,8,*Spoiler Alert*
This is a Movie Collectors dream film,kevinkishin,18 March 2020,9,"Yo! This film is unapologetic true grit at it's best, the characters are hashed out well the plot is beautiful I can't asked for anything more, a must watch."
Only Hell and high water in the City Of God...,whoTheFuqRyou,8 July 2004,,"City Of God is based on actual events that went on in the ghettos of Rio De Janeiro from the eyes of one who grows to be a photographer(Rocket).  The picture is very grainy because it's shot w/ a Digi-cam but its graininess bring the film out.  Backed by a solid and unorthodox script, Cidade De Deus is actually one of the better crime stories you will see.  The film presents the street life from the Brazilian perspective and it's very believable as Rio De Janeiro, Brazil is one of the more hostile, though beautiful, cities in the world - not to mention the fact that I lived in Jamaica at one point in my life and saw the similarities such as little kids running around with guns and the struggle itself.  The script does a lot of the ""what comes around goes around"" thing with some particular characters and shows that no matter who you are that if you push a man enough times that he will start to push back."
"Finally, a real gang movie.",wastebot,16 March 2003,10,10 of 10
Violence in Brasil,Heikki-Tulokas,20 December 2005,9,"We are often warned about the dangers in Brasil. Thank Goodness, I didn't watch this one before my first trip to Brasil. But afterwards, it is a hypnotizing film. The changes in time makes you follow the movie more carefully, you don't want to miss the action. The violence in the movie, yes, it is a very violent one, is not the same kind like in the Hollywood-films, or in some raw European modern movies. It doesn't play with the amount of blood: When they shoot someone, you get the idea without slowmotion close-ups! It's better this way. I like the simplicity of the Brazilian actors. No over-acting is needed, this is a movie of the life in favelas as it was, or even is today, as I have heard."

And we will also for a gun's flexibility, good at seizing the moment quietly happy
Don't talk about the values the movie wants to express from the perspective of humanity, care for the world and so on."
Cidade de Deus,Marcus-Aurelius90,21 July 2017,,"""City of God"" is an excellent crime drama. If you don't speak Portuguese this movie does have subtitles. This is a lethal crime film that uses violence masterfully. At times excessive, its even more disturbing when you see how young the gangsters are in this film and how cold and calm they are while killing people they consider enemies."
A city abandoned by God,x-54313,4 May 2020,9,"A shocking film. Yes, the impact of this film is hard to describe in words. First of all, the level of the director is very high, the shooting techniques and editing methods are quite avant-garde, and the soundtrack also has a huge contrast effect with the theme"
Incredible,sdurham-66337,5 October 2018,10,"This is one of the best movies I've seen in quite awhile. I had no idea what it was about going into it, and the rawness and humanity of it really hit me as I watched it for the first time."
An amazing portrayal of the slums and gangster life in Rio De Janiero,Brettyboy007,7 August 2014,10,"I saw this movie on Netflix one night and decided to watch it, because I'm into gangster movies. This is the best gangster movie I've ever seen, (beside watching The Sopranos on HBO). It is based on a true story about a kid who strives to become a photographer and stay away from the dark side of drugs/executions/rape in the slums."
Good but long,asenkron,14 November 2007,7,"The story starts with the early times of the City of God showing where many of the problems stem from- the extreme poverty, overcrowding etc. In this time,the director introduces the main characters with you.The story revolves mainly around Rocket and Lil Ze, and how they take two different paths through life. Rocket dreams to become a photographer and to escape the City of God.On contrary, Lil Ze becomes a powerful gang leader and drug dealer."
Rated too high but deserves top 250,hyder_sagg2003,13 October 2007,8,i Liked the movie. but too much violence and centers a unethical subject. Directed extremely well this is one of the movie impressed me.... entire movie has no single minus point of direction. If it was in English i could have grossed a lot. The movie is not the best crime movie of all the time not even near them but it is one of the best crime-thrillers i have ever seen.
Captures Lightning in a bottle,ColeSear,4 February 2003,10,"""'Cidade de Deus' captures lightning in a bottle. Like many, if not all of the internationally reknowned Brazilian films of the past decade 'Cidade de Deus shows us a segment of the Brazilian population in near perfect cinematic simulacrum. A story whose structure is indebted to ""Citizen Kane"" and is just as intellectually stimulating, this films narrative moves circularly telling the tales of many characters who become the central figures in a 'favela'. Rarely is criminality portrayed in such dimension, there is not one 'no-nonsense, tough as nails, born a jerk will die a jerk in this but. The characterization separates and explains the motivations of each main cast member perfectly. The word circular works also to describe the nature of the story which is one of crime and corruption; it is something that never ends as we all know but the filmmaking is so captivating that we expect a 'happy ends' but love the truth the film shows regardless. The Samba-infused score and  frenetic cinematography work hand in hand to add rhythm and emotion where it is needed but the cold, shocking and gut-wrenching scenes are left as is and work wonderfully. This is a film worth multiple viewings and careful examination and is a rarity a great piece of art that ALSO makes a socio-political statement."
One of the best of 2002,campblood13,2 October 2003,8,"I enjoyed this all the way through, which doesn't happen very often.  The characters are so real and raw that you forget it is just a movie.  The truth is that things could have been like this at the place and time.  I don't want to get to detailed into this, but it's not your regular rip-off gangster movie that some people call it.  It has a heart and soul all to itself.  The scenes with kids no older than 4 being involved in shootings and getting shot are very powerful.  Check this film out, it's a winner. 8/10 Very Good"
"A great film, a perfect 10",moneystacks511,23 August 2007,10,"All i have to say is that from the first time i saw this movie, i felt it was one of the best i had ever, ever seen. Just an extremely powerful, funny, sad, and overall amazing piece of work.I can't believe that most of these kids had never acted before, their performances were so good. Many powerful scenes and great interweaving of the story and its characters. This film also made me a big fan of Seu Jorge along with the life aquatic. I saw him live in concert a few months ago in Chicago and he was great! Im not a big fan of subtitled films but this movie is so good you don't even realize that you're reading it. A great great movie, a perfect 10! If you haven't seen it, or you have but you've got friends that haven't, sit them down and watch it with them!"
Wow,carteros,20 October 2021,9,"Incredibly well made film, looovvved the cinematography in this movie it made it feel like you were there with them. Other than that not much else to say that hasn't been said before, check this one out for sure!"
Well done foreign film,karlysoy,15 October 2018,9,"I am a big fan of this foreign film, because it's nice to see directors having a different point of view then the classic Hollywood film. It's a fast pace movie with subtitles, but worth the watch. City of God is the epitome of a great foreign film. It showcases the classic struggle between right and wrong, in a twist of lifestyle differences. The raw directing style, coupled with a great soundtrack makes for a movie which many different kinds of people can enjoy. Whether you are a top scholar or someone just wanting to watch a film this movie is for both. The continuity of editing helped the movie flow. Also, the vicious cycle of the gangster lifestyle is portrayed with cringing accuracy. The many close up of characters help you sympathize with people you thought you wouldn't be able to. All in all, City of God is a very well done film which you can find yourself relating to a whole different lifestyle."
speechless,Gjay2,26 March 2003,9,"bang, the first minute of city of god. Fast cutting, overlapped sound effects, wonderful camera shots, great music. What a way to start. And the brilliance of the first 5 minutes, is just a prelude of whats to come. Usually telling a story of this scope and size is very difficult to pull off, but the director easily succeeds in keeping an audience's eyes wide open throughout the whole picture. It's most definatly shocking. Some of the scenes are hard to watch, with some of it's documentary style approach. It is also very funny, and very poignant. Being a foreign film, i knew none of the actors, but it just made it all so much better. The friendships really seem genuine, and when some of the friendships fall, you literally feel the emotion pour out of the screen. Lil ze, the more deadly character in the film is played brilliantly, and whenever he's on screen, looking towards the camera, you almost feel obliged to walk away. Like you are being bullied or something."
Amazing Storyline,mschultz-26078,15 October 2018,9,"In the Film City of God, Directors, Fernando Meirelles and Katia Lund, do an excellent job conveying the story of a young boy who lives in a favela known as the City of God. They show his story growing up in poverty and the pursuit of his dream of being a photographer. With use of excellent motifs and stunning order of events this Film earns two thumbs up in my book.
 One motif that stood out to me during the screening of the film was the relation of Good and Evil. Many times, throughout the film, characters reference the idea of ""Love and peace"". In reality, this idea was stretched most times to being evil. Even many Characters who lived peacefully, found their downfall by facing evil head on. 
 Another thing I found spectacular in the Film was the order the story was shown in. The opening scene of the movie was the most important and actually serves as the climax of the film. The opening scene also conveys a series of flashbacks (or even flashbacks inside of flashbacks) in which story is described and narrated. Throughout this description, we learn about all the characters and their importance to that final scene. It was an interesting and powerful way to convey the story nonetheless.
 In short, the Film City of God is a must see for anyone who enjoys strong storyline where little is left to the imagination. In the Span of a couple hours, you will laugh, be sad, and even be heartbroken. I Recommend the film to everyone to see!"
whoa!,moviefan2003va,12 January 2005,9,"As a comfortably middle classed, American living in suburbia, my initial reaction is whoa! This one packs a punch. At first, it is honestly difficult to care about a single character. But then it hits you, these are all children, kids. All the main characters doing the killing are kids. This draws you into the film and the thought that many (if not all) of these kids never really had a chance. Rocket is fortunate to become interested early on in the craft of photography and this interest paves the way for a better life for him. However, others who only know about survival and aren't privy to extracurricular interests like Rocket's have their fates sealed. Benny is the other character you begin to care about. He realizes too late there is more to life than being a hood. He spares a life that later takes his own. Such is the cycle of violence that infects the City of God."
10 Things I love About City of God,swordsandsandals,11 October 2008,,"1. Where to start? It's such a stunning, powerful and provocative film, to try and summarise it in 10 points is a little silly. And I'll probably still struggle. Let's start with the visuals. It's a real credit to Fernando Meireilles that he manages to make each new confrontation fresh and exciting. The editing, cutting and lighting all contributes to a visceral, involving experience. This isn't something I normally notice in a film, but as Dantes inferred, you can't help but notice it in City of God. But what is particularly noticeable, is that it doesn't lose passion or heart amongst the fancy visuals."
"Finally, Roger Ebert gets one right",Craig-9,21 April 2003,10,"What an incredible film! Recently, when Roger Ebert was praising this to the high heavens, I had to wonder--lately he seems to be awfully full of gushing hyperbole (_The Hunted_ was ""a pure and inspire chase film""--did he see the same crapfest I wasted my money on?). But _City of God_ is actually worthy of the acclaim. This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time and it does very well what you want the best films to do--take you someplace you've never been before, someplace you couldn't go even if you wanted to. Sure, it is a violent film, but no more violent than something like _Gangs of New York_, and the violence here is all to a purpose--showing what happens to gang kids who grow up without any chance, without any guidance. The film is closer to something like _Goodfellas_ anyway, in showing the rise and fall of a gangster, and showing the development of a gangster culture, from the 60s into the 70s, as the relatively innocent marijuana business gives way to the more profitable and violent cocaine trade. The film is almost Dickensian in showing how a place affects the people who live there, and while it calls for change, it never does so in a preachy way. This is just an amazing, vivid, astonishing experience and you owe it to yourself to see this film in a theater if you can, on video otherwise."

The best Brazilain movie and one the world best movies ever,gabrielbastos-07277,21 July 2020,10,"""Cidade de Deus"" is a emblematic masterpiece!.
In the first Scene (the running chicken) we can see that what we´re gonna watch is not a ""more of the same"" movie."
a brief evaluation,t-81966-84968,12 April 2020,8,"The film is beautifully edited, with a storylike narrative and subheadings, paragraph by paragraph. For someone with a bad memory like me, that's good. Not only did I remember all the stories, but I also remembered all the names. And it's hard to connect without a bit of artificiality or awkwardness. The story is crisp, with no 'soft' plotlines, and, in short, very tough."
Very amusing film.,ruffinelli_ro,17 June 2010,9,"I don't really remember the first time I watched this movie. It was many years ago, but I do recall that I loved it. I don't know if this a very realistic movie, but it certainly feels like it is."
City of Devil,andrelcramalho,17 February 2019,3,"It is unfortunate that there is so much poverty and misery. Nevertheless Brazilians should not be proud. Film presents the emergence of the first gang of robbers, until the early 1980s, where the big business is drug trafficking. Presents life in the favelas as it really is, violence, strong crime scenes, a real civil war, where children feel proud to commit crimes. Depressing."
You have to see this movie before you die!,BasBsbll1,31 May 2006,10,"City of God would have to be one of the most important films that has come out of this current decade. It is visually stunning and the acting is some the best acting to come out of non-actors. The film is in the mold of Goodfellas, just a chronicle of crime from youth to adulthood."
8/10,stjackson10,26 January 2020,8,"This movie reminded me of my experience watching Beasts of No Nation. It was wonderfully made and frightfully upsetting. I felt as if I got a glimpse into a world I needed to experience but never wanted to. It is dark, it is chilling, it is hopeful, and it leaves you with more than you signed up to leave with. Not something I'm anxious to rewatch, but a masterful film."
Ive rewatched this,trminator-35198,17 January 2019,6,"The first time I fell asleep watching this but a rewatch showed me this is a very powerful and tastefully done film. Its not the most enjoyable ive witnessed and was even clichè in some instances, that aside, it was well made."
city of god,yiyuantiming,5 April 2020,9,"""City of God"" showed crime and horror in the slums of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. This is the ""City of God"" and the capital of sin. The film witnesses the brutal, ambition and greed of the slums from the perspective of the protagonist. The living environment shown in the film, the observation and exposure of life are all bold attempts. The Rio slums, which are the real location, have added more wild and thick brushstrokes. The power of the chaotic disorder in Rio 's slums is that all aesthetics are also loved by many film and television works."
Whoa ...,kickstand,17 February 2004,,"Unlike some highly praised non-English language films I can think of, (um, like FAST RUNNER), City of God features dynamic cinematography, brilliant editing, and just-plain-cool film techniques. The first five minutes are among the best cinema I've ever seen (and I've seen a lot). It's a masterpiece, a movie with no digital effects but nonetheless on a par with LORD OF THE RINGS for its depiction of a world utterly alien to me. And it's based, apparently, on a true story."

One of The Best Movies I Have Seen,ashholecigarclub,15 May 2020,10,"City Of God is one of my all time favorites. The camera angles, the scenes and the story behind it brings it all together. It tells a story of being looked at like your nothing going through life wanting more that what you can see, which is the slums of going nowhere. There is beauty in the struggle, know you are going to make something of yourself and this movies just sat right with me."

Uncultured hooligans will only see the surface of violence, and the irresistible human nature behind it is enough to destroy everything. The best armed force is civilization, which is a hundred times more terrible than violence."

absolutely unmatchable.,joao_miguel_54,25 September 2006,10,"I'm studying cinematographic and as a ""homework"" I had to watch a foreign movie and write about it... as Brazil it's different from Portugal i gave this movie a try... I was astonished by the beauty of the entire film, we found ourselves in a new world, one of those we thought that couldn't exist... too evil and miserable that even in our most dreadful nightmares we would never had. Cidade de Deus takes us to a reality we try to hide from our minds, a place where drugs, murders, betrayals and so on are common, a place where the good and evil is distinguished only in the minds of each ones as there are nearly no rules. It was amazingly performed, the director made a uber masterpiece. don't take attention to those guys who said this was a bad movie... as a movie addict and as a student of this I assure you... this is absolutely AWESOME!!!!"
Heartbreaking and horrifying. Don't miss it.,sublime501,23 May 2004,9,"CIDADE DE DEUS is one of the best foreign films I have ever seen. Actually, I haven't seen many. Hopefully, since this movie started that trend with me, that category will become more popular with me."

Brilliant!! Brilliant!! Brilliant!!,GAKAS,23 October 2005,10,"Go and get this movie. Put it in your collection. If you do not live in the ""City of God"", you will thank your lucky stars that you were not born there after seeing this movie and make you appreciate what you have. I had been wanting to see this movie for a while and just never really sat down to give a chance. I knew it was made in 2002 and I was about to watch it in 2005 after so many people telling me it was a great movie. I didn't know anything about the plot so I had no idea what to expect either. To help me along I was longing to see a great movie in 2005. All I ask for is to see one outstanding film per year, and the others can be good or great. But I need to see one outstanding movie per year, and thats what I got in October 2005. The year is almost over and I was losing hope. Story 10/10, Directing 10/10, Movie as a whole 10/10. If you love movies, this is a movie yo must see before you die."
Such a raw and insightful film,vanessapeinado-01555,13 October 2020,9,"The use of sound in this movie is very different from the typical movies being released at this time. I would say overall this movie is very different, I think it is more real than what I've seen lately. When I say real I mean there is not a lot of advanced effects or serious CGI going on. There was the use of the split-screen and some other minor effects but nothing too grand to make the movie seem like a made-up story. The limit of these effects makes the movie real to me, almost as if the audience is right there with them. I also think the sound helps bring the realness to life because the background noises of washing dishes or the gravel on the ground are loud enough to be noticed. They are at the volume they would be as if you were right there, or pretty close to it. I think that the ambient sounds are the most used sound effect and it helps give a perspective of the location and even time period. I would say that the diegetic music also helps illuminate the time period with the party music they listen to and the overlapping of the voices adds to this raw, realness vibe I keep mentioning. The narration helps the timeline flow and easier to follow. It takes us along and gives us what we need to know to put the pieces together and understand the characters. Overall, I like this film because it gives an insight into what it was like to live in the slums and the film was portrayed very well."
World's best crime film,narenjbm,13 December 2019,10,"Contain many twists,characters in the film and it's starting to ending is most remarkable screenplay it's a best film I ever seen."
Brilliant!,sweetrindthefilm,21 October 2022,10,"This film is a true masterpiece - one that should be placed in the category with classics like Pulp Fiction and The Shawshank Redemption. It has managed to achieve a depth that many films with much bigger budgets had not, no doubt lending to its huge box office success."
this,syedhassan-65961,28 December 2021,1,"Of this movie about the drug problem in Rio in the present day. However, it and the film itself are very intense and bloody so I would not allow kids or even teens to view the film. It's really a shame, as most of the way through the documentary I realized it would be a great thing."
My Favorite Movie,chriscruzny,2 January 2005,10,"A story like this cannot be written. Only true circumstances in life can generate a tale as the one depicted in City Of God. The simple fact that this was a true story makes this movie even more dumbfounding and astonishing at the same time. This movie is a visual masterpiece in it's crispness and story telling. The format in which the story is told is unique through the eyes of Rocket. The actors pull you into a world that most don't know exist and even through their vile nature and ways of thinking, there is something to love about everyone involved. Watch as Bene becomes a playboy, as Knock-Out Ned becomes a legend and Rocket becomes a man. I have watched this movie numerous times and find myself watching scenes over and over again. Few movies compel one to do so. Sit back and enjoy it."
Absoloutley brilliant ****1/2 out of five,prendevi,24 May 2003,9,"Absoloutley brilliant film. Definetly one of the best films I've seen so far this year. A mesmerising crime thriller. I love Quentin Tarantino and his movies he is my idol. This is very much like a Quentin Tarantino movie, so absoloutley adored it."

The reality inside the Favelas,adeilsoncs,22 January 2021,9,Excellent title that shows the Brazilian reality through the favelas of Rio de Janeiro. The film tries to faithfully and transparently reproduce organized crime within the favelas.
Be careful where you visit,Keyska2004,15 November 2010,10,"Rio is a beautiful city, but the edge of the city lies in chaos. Your are what you live, and in this culture it is not what you would ever dream of. Kids, gangs, drugs, killing, sex, life, death, all before they are 15 years of age. The interaction and distrust of the gang members will turn your stomach upside down. I was mesmerized by this film. It was like Lord of the Flies, but with machine guns. The story was intriguing, but dark. I love photography, and I like how Alexandre Rodrigues who played ""Rocket"" was always taking pictures and trying to make a living. After you finish watching this great film, take the time to watch the two hour special of the actual gangs in Rio. I almost think that this biography is better than the film."
One of the greatest movies ever made !!!,lsmassive,12 November 2006,10,"When this movie came out, I saw it 5 times in 7 days in the theater. I was waiting at tower at midnight the night that it came out and I bought two copies (one to lend out and one to keep). The documentary that came with the movie was also great ""News from a personal war"". I can't believe that the director followed this up with ""the constant gardener"", which I thought sucked in comparison. It was a decent movie, but next to City Of God, it failed to even compare. Brutal reality brilliantly shot and acted would probably be the best way to describe this movie. The Soundrack is also incredible. I was never aware of the situation in Brazil with the crime and corruption until viewing this film. This flick was a powerful way to get that message out to the American and international public."

Story of daily life in a Brazillian hood..,troniix,24 May 2006,10,"Phenomenal friggan movie. This was one of the few subtitled movies I have ever seen, that was so good, I didn't even notice I was having to read the lines. I almost could have seen the Spanish version and would have been able to follow the movie. The acting was ridiculous, even the kids put Oscar performances on the table. During the end credits a clip rolls that was portrayed in the movie, and it showed how dead-nuts on the directing, cinematography, sets, cast were. It added a startling realism to what you just seen, then you begin to ponder what it has to be like living in those slums. In the end you are happy that the story teller, does eventually make it out and is successful, but at the same time, the gripping reality hits you, that out of all the characters of the story one ONE, makes it out. A sad life I am now even more thankful my family and I don't have to live. great movie, skip rental, and buy the damn DVD."
WoW!,Patel_KH,13 August 2009,8,"WOW! The movie was excellent but the story is truly SAD. Can you imagine how insane it is to shoot a running Chicken with a gun...It was CRAZY right from the opening scene. The actors did a tremendous job (never seemed like they were acting). I'm giving it 8 stars (instead of 10) because there was no positive message in the end...It was implied that the life of misery in the City of God would continue. Make no mistake- the movie is Great but at the same time TERRIFYING. I don't know if they could've made a more better movie than this, It had everything and was almost PERFECT."
Brazilian Masterpiece!,gratatatata,4 May 2021,9,"City of God is a movie you get combining elements from movies such as ""Goodfellas"" and then adding a whole new element to camera usage and character development. Amazing performances by every one, especially by Leandro Firmino who portrays the main villian in this film. Great feel to this movie and great emotions are captured! Would also like to add that the soundtrack is great. An amazing movie, and a must-watch in my opinion!"
A different story,palashdebrayd,23 June 2021,10,"Gangsters are presented from a new perspective, it's not to be judged, it' just mean to have a worth watch."
What an amazing film!,regamalytis,4 January 2007,10,"A Truly masterful film. I caught it on TV last week and was awestruck. The cinematography was unique and strangely fitting considering the gritty nature of the movie. Most directors would have chosen to shoot the film on 16mm to make it as 'real' looking as possible, but Meirelles and Lund have taken a risk and reaped the rewards. I was amazed to find out that the runts were not actors but genuine street kids. The characters of Benny and Lil'Ze were particularly well drawn, two best friends composing a yin/yang relationship which keeps the ghetto in order."
Perfectionw!,saltoaccess,9 June 2021,9,Perfectionw! Perfectione! Perfectionism! Perfectiosiedjfm!
What a ride this movie is!,carvercape,24 October 2010,10,"If there were no music cues and blending frames you'll be wondering if this is a movie you are watching. Camera and framing are quite explicit as you are one of the actors and that is quite compelling considering the plot and story. Photography is superb and fits the movie like a glove. Acting is beyond par and at the more than few moments it will feel so real you will be at the edge of your seat. I will not reveal any of the story as this movie is a rare breed, fast paced, action packed to the maximum. And do expect lot of gory scenes because this is not for a faint hearted part of audience. If you consider yourself a true fan of movie art, than this one is a must see. Superb and simply brilliant from the start till the very end."
"I'm Brazilian and honestly, i don't get the hype.",allanllipe,14 July 2022,5,I will try to write a spoiler-free review.
Watched a Movie that I could give 9 Stars ⭐ after a long time.,sahebaazbanzara,4 April 2020,9,"In Short, Everything was perfect and awesome in this movie.
It was a Masterpiece!"
A big disappointment,cakyolcu,12 May 2020,1,"I do not really understand all those ""10 points"" here. I only watched the first hour of the movie and to be honest the last 20 min of it was battle with myself in terms of patience. Poor narrative, trivially no-sense violence,
superficial handling of characters (children killing around), sorry but no story at all!! As I am also from a developing country I am pretty much aware of all those sad stories in ghettos, however this one could have been told in such a dramatic way which the movie did not. And it is dramatic; there is nothing ""fun"" about it."
Best foreign Drama/Action film I have seen...,MrNefarious,6 April 2003,9,"Simply amazing. I gave this film nine out of ten. Time and time again I have been surprised at how good foreign films can be. ""Y tu mamá también"" was a great foreign film I seen recently as well. However it cannot compare to the depth and feeling that you get from ""Cidade de Deus"" or as us Americans would call it ""City of God"". Not only is it a story told very well,but it also is shot very well. I had never seen such great production value out of a foreign film that wasn't an action adventure or anime film. I would be interested in seeing a documentary about the making of this film."
R for repetitive,Shakespeare-2,5 March 2003,,"I'll admit up front that ""City of God"" is technically stylish and innovative filmmaking. But as storytelling, it leaves a great deal to be desired. And talk about violent! After two hours, I felt as if I had watched a year of American television. I lost track of the shots fired and the bodies piling up. I suppose ""City of God"" is meant to be a shocking commentary on the state of Brazilian society, but I very quickly stopped caring about any of the characters or what happened to them. If the film had been less scattered and more focused, and if it had been less cynical and more hopeful, I might have sat up and paid attention. As it is, I spent much of the film either wishing it was over, or sleeping through it. (Mind you, I'm probably the only person who ever slept through the D-Day sequence of ""Saving Private Ryan"". But that's another story.)"
"a shallow story, all be it a well told one",amigoPaulo,3 February 2003,7,"This is the Brazilian version of `Boyz N the Hood'  but City of God is two notches better, yet with a few shortcomings."
One of the best movies ever,SimpletonX,19 March 2007,10,"There's really nothing I can say that hasn't already been said about this movie. It is nothing short of amazing. The story draws the viewer in almost immediately, and the beautiful imagery and style of the film is constantly sweeping you from one emotion to the next. The story is so amazingly compelling, that it's impossible to look away. I love foreign films, but even those who don't would love this movie. It is one of my favorites outside any genre. There is no way that anyone wouldn't be effected by this movie, it is an example of film at its very best, rife with satire, social commentary, as well as humor it is a movie that none should miss."
Pulp'ish Goodfellas,phreakv6-1,18 May 2005,9,"I thought Godfather,Goodfellas were the best gangster movies ever made.This movie was comparable and at places even better than Goodfellas.But considering Goodfellas was released 13 years before Cidade de deus puts Goodfellas in a different league altogether.Cidade de deus has awesome cinematography ( Cesar Charlone - Oscar nominated ),totally offbeat editing ( Daniel Rezende - Oscar nominated ),scintillating screenplay (Braulio Montavani - Oscar nominated ) and some good direction.The audio was in Portuguese but the subtitles were pretty good to follow the movie.The movie is styled similar to pulp fiction since the answers are given first and questions asked later in almost all the anachronous sub-plots ( like chapters in pulp).The movie is narrated by Rocket,a journalist who takes just a minor role in the movie ( btw. this is a true story).The story is set in 60's Rio de Janiero and revolves around a ghetto.Its very powerful and disturbing with kids carrying guns and robbing motels, shooting to kill,sniffing n selling drugs.Its somewhat reminded me of Black Hawk Down but this is a war amidst drug lords unlike the war in BHD. ""I sniff,I steam,I kill.I'm man"" uttered by a 12 year old speaks of the way the kids of the ghetto use their pistols as toys. Overall, a beautiful masterpiece that will take you on a time travel to the 60's Rio."
Mind-blowing......CIDADE DE DEUS.... CITY OF GOD.,akrahul,3 June 2020,10,"The first ever foreign language film i loved so much, easily in my all time greatest movie's list, each and every frame of the movie is a craftsmanship....., a flawless dark masterpiece. The best darkest movie ever made."
"Please, not that good...",snncy2000,24 March 2008,,"Well first of all I was expecting much more harsh movie, but City of God only disturbed me at some minor scenes (shooting small children etc.) but even those scenes were not so strongly shot."
Fantastic movie!,jiffyxpop,14 March 2004,10,"I nearly didn't see this movie because of the underrated movie reviews I read about it in the local paper and the New Yorker.  This movie is superb in every aspect -- the acting, the story and the way it is told, the direction, the use of special effects, the music soundtrack, all of it. This is a movie more people should see, as its implications regarding poverty, politics, violence, drug dealing, guns, and human nature are rich and complex. There are so many different themes you could follow, so much meaning to this movie, which to top it all off, is based on a true story, it could be the basis of numerous theses, criticism and essays. This is certainly one of the most powerful, moving, fascinating and exhilarating movie I've seen in a very long time."
Not so good,nickmat-2,21 February 2008,4,"One more mediocre film that is over-rated, I can't understand at all why this film is being considered a masterpiece receiving such high ratings. For me the top 250 films list of the IMDb has ceased to have any validity when it comes to deciding what films to watch, time and again I was let down. Some films in it are good but many are terrible."
Brutal and Overrated,pauleky,30 August 2021,4,"This is easily one of the most overrated films I have ever seen. Nonstop violence and glorifying a lifestyle that is disgusting. Yeah, there are terrible consequences to these people, but for over two hours we have to watch human after human be massacred. It all just seems so pointless. It's well-made and beautifully photographed, but I hated almost every minute of it."
Visceral and Fabulous,PixelmateGraphics,9 October 2022,10,"""City of God"" is an adrenaline jolt of a film that for once manages to find a balance between stylistics and substance."
10 out of 10,antaleixo_filmmaker,14 February 2023,10,An absolute master piece. Fernando Meirelles nailed it.
hyperviolence stylized and glorified,greatdeceivah,20 March 2017,,"I live in one of the top 10 most violent cities in the world. After Living just a few miles away from one of the thousands of Latin America ghettos, i find that the story portrayed in this film is nothing new, shocking or amazing.. it has been going on, over and over again for decades...Teenage gangsters and hit men, pregnant teens, drug cartels, turf killings, high unemployment, corruption, YAWN... tell me another story."
Amazing and terrifyingly realistic movie.,bubbathom,9 August 2008,10,"I was going through the top 250 seeing which movies looked good and I came upon City of God. I was kind of skeptical at first because of the subtitles, but I got it anyways. The movie is very unique, taking the whole gangster concept to a different level, using young men who basically feel they have no choice but to become hoodlums and deal drugs. Rocket, the main character, is very likable and funny at times. I felt for the characters and thought the actors were very, very good. As I said, it seems so real, because if I'm not mistaken, it's based on a true story. It's kind of disturbing sometimes to see young kids dealing drugs, smoking, and shooting other people(or getting shot at), but it makes it very intense. I thought the subtitles were going to get really annoying, but I got used to them fast and they only bothered me a few times when they were talking pretty fast. Overall, I feel this movie is unique, awesome, and great. Very deserving of the high rating it has right now, 10/10."
"Wanting too much, gets convoluted",submitme,8 February 2020,6,I've been wanting to watch this movie for a long time. But ended up not being pulled in.
It's the City of God. It's Real.,ericventura,4 July 2017,9,"This is a documentary, not a film. It shows the slums as they are. A well filmed story of nothing more than the slums, there is no more emotion than the emotion of the observer. What we get is splendid, but it is not a film. It is beautiful, but not perfect."
Filmmaking at its FINEST,Sunrise_Studios,19 February 2018,10,Hands down the greatest movie I have ever scene. A very powerful story with the most artistic imagination to recreate it. I don't think anyone else may taken this story and portrayed it any better.
Visionary!,grendel-37,23 July 2003,9,Simply put this is probably the finest movie you haven't seen. After an extremely limited engagement in the states this critically acclaimed film disappeared from the few theaters that were actually showing it. The loss is ours.
A great movie,ramamendez,27 February 2016,9,This is maybe one of my favorite movies. It can kick the big ass of the most films of Hollywood. It's a shame that it didn't win an Oscar.
perhaps the most amazing movie ever done,mkham6,4 June 2005,,"This is probably the most amazing movie ever done. Seriously, run and rent this movie- it was in such demand, I had to wait 3-4 months to get it from the library (though now Hollywood Video has unlimited movies for $10/month). No matter what your believe, your faith, your world ; it will blow you away. It's simply stunning- I spent 3½ hours watching a 2:10 hours movie- because I had to stop and watch scenes over again because I couldn't believe what I had seen. This is a great movie, one that bears watching again and again, so you can see all you missed. Watched at normal speed, this has the impact of a shotgun shell to the chest- it's so concentrated and such a potent mix of film-making wizardry that it's overwhelming. It's not for the weak of heart or stomach  one has to accept the casual exchange of bullets and death without crawling in a corner. But, for someone who has moved past that, it is the most impressive thing I've ever seen: the trials and tribulations of a group of Brazilian slum dwellers that will etch itself on your consciousness."
Epic Storytelling,jasonupah,10 June 2016,10,City of God stands above many other movies.
"No Spoilers, just a plea for you to see this film",Neil_MacLeod,6 November 2004,10,"This movie got a lot of publicity when it came out, and is deservedly #23 on the top 250 list here on the IMDb. In the off chance you are browsing that list for movies you haven't seen yet and thus reading this comment: do yourself a favor and go rent/steal/borrow this movie. A ""tour de force"" {I think that's French for bloody amazing :) } of movie-making, it has to be seen to be believed. It speaks not just to the degradations and hardships of life in a Rio slum, but in any impoverished area in the world. I just now saw it, the same weekend I caught ""Secret Window"" at the cinema here in Nippon, the 5th Element on TV (again) and ""The Core"" on DVD... like comparing a diamond in the rough to 3 lumps of cubic zirconium... buried in feces... in a septic tank... : )"
Heaven is also hell,e-60319,25 July 2020,8,"It's an amazing movie. Yes, the impact of the film is hard to describe in words. First of all, the director's level is very high, the shooting techniques and editing methods are quite avant-garde, and the soundtrack also forms a huge contrast effect with the theme. The more cruel the story is, the more unrestrained the music is. The slums of Rio de Janeiro, the closest place in the world to hell, the movie really restores what happened there Everything, starting from the children, is lawless."
"As it says on the case, ""one of the best films you'll ever see.""",wxynem,7 May 2008,10,"This film is a brilliant depiction of the life of ""Rocket."" It is modern in its filming style, the story is captivating, and the screenplay is tremendous. It is a film that leaves you thinking, questioning your own life by comparison to the ones portrayed. The film by far broadened my mind of Rio De Janeiro. Before watching this film, I knew little of Brazil. Only that their soccer players are amazing. Nonetheless, it left me with nothing else to do but research the real life of the self-made photographer, ""Rocket."" As a photographer, a student, and just as any person, I definitely give this film 10 out of 10."
"So real and true, a must see",trevorj-38641,7 May 2022,9,"Amazing on all fronts, acting ranges from fantastic to scary, one scene still has me baffled if its real or not, check out when two kids have to be shot, just great direction and story ,a must watch."
Gangster epic in Rio with some great narratives,pascaloetterli,12 September 2014,8,"""Cidade de deus"" (Famous Favela of Rio de Janeiro)"
"This movie lacks sensibility? Unfortunately, so does reality.",vebazzo,9 July 2008,10,"I read many comments complaining that this movie doesn't do much to make you care about the characters and therefore doesn't connect you emotionally with the plot. I just want to point out that this lack of sensibility doesn't represent a flaw from the director or the script. Do you really think that people who grow up trying to be constantly high on drugs to escape reality, struggling to survive and numbed down by the omnipresent violence manage to become very sensitive or deeply caring? Unfortunately not. As a Brazilian who had his share of experience with violence, it's clear to me that the state of mind in which these ""gangsters"" live don't leave much space for meaningful emotional development. I am sure the director wanted to show us how does it feel to be there and how small is the presence of sanity and hope (portrayed mostly by Rocket) amidst the chaos; and the fundamental importance to nurture them."
An incredible presentation of an existing violent reality,sl-pierce,15 May 2011,9,"City of God is not only a true eye-opener to the horrors of criminal life in the ""favelas"" of Brazil, but the cinematography alone is enough to leave you on the edge of your seat, begging for more. Fernando Meirelles' use of lightening and shadows and filmed snapshots is incredible and augments the symbolism of the camera in Buscapé's life journey. I enjoyed how the film progressed in a novel-like fashion, imitating the book that it portrayed with various ""chapters,"" each of which described a particular character's story. Likewise, the development of a large number of characters is sometimes too daunting to attempt in a 2-hour film, but I thought it was well accomplished in City of God. Finally, the plot itself was simply an amazing and stark depiction of the violent reality that exists in the Brazilian ghetto, to the point that murder became even a normal part of daily life for young children. That's certainly a thought to chew on for some time."
Sounds in the City of God,AJames101,30 July 2008,10,"Fernando Meirelles did an amazing job directing the film City of God. He didn't just direct, he sculpted the lives of the characters the viewer sees on screen and allows the audience to know them. He almost makes it possible for a viewer to even feel what they feel. It is a dark world in the City of God, but it is also a loud one."
Brilliant Masterpiece from Brazil,CinemaPat,4 November 2010,10,"""A kid? I smoke, I snort. I've killed and robbed. I'm a man."""
EVERYTHING GANGS OF NEW YORK SHOULD HAVE BEEN... and more!,joelovesbabs,15 March 2003,,"Colorful, tremendously exhilarating and truly horrifying to learn that this was based on a true story. Impeccable editing, unique narrative  and flashy visuals tell this story of depravity and survival among it. How this film was not nominated for an Academy Award, we will never know. In my book, the best foreign film of 2002. (Tied with TALK TO HER)."
Amazing film,froboz,29 June 2003,10,"Amazing film about boys growing up as gangsters in a Rio De Janeiro ghetto. I haven't been there, and don't want to go! It is not a complete narrative about the ghetto, but a violent and living thing, full of machismo. You lack the perspective from the women, the peaceful children, the workers - those that kept everyday going through the mayhem. So it is in essence a gangster movie. Cinematically, and partly in subject, it reminded me a lot of the 1974 O Amuleto De Ogum. I saw little documentation for that one, but check it out if you have a chance - it saw it on swedish television ages ago, and it ""blew me away"" much as this one. There are also other violent argentinian movies, and I wish I could make a proper list, but I know to little. Maybe later. I see references to Pulp Fiction and Goodfellas...but these comparisons are misplaced. Especially, some young americans should learn not to call everything Tarantino. There's a story of gangsters movies, and there's a tradition of gangster movies, that go way back, and which is international. I enjoyed the movie fully, because of all aspects - actors, cinematography, the depiction of kiddie gangs, the brutality. It is genre perfect. But even a top movie, a 1o points movie, is allowed to be critized. I think that the playing with time - introducing scenes in advance, and making us confused, was unnessesary. Even if everything was nicely explained in the end, it would have better flow with straight story telling. I often wonder why gangster leaders are so irrational, like Ze in this movie. They just can't use those violent methods and expect to succeed. But I guess those sociopats are the one that leave most stories to be told after them."
The Best Cinematography ever,evolucaofilmes,16 February 2023,10,"Released in 2002, City of God was a true phenomenon of national cinema. To this day, the film is acclaimed as one of the greatest works that the seventh Tupiniquim art has ever produced. The film, based on the book of the same name by Paulo Lins, tells the story of several characters from the Cidade de Deus favela, especially Buscapé (Alexandre Rodrigues), who is also the narrator of the film. From this premise, we are introduced to the different stories whose intersections culminate in the work of Fernando Meirelles."
Brilliant! Outstanding movie,jpdiez,5 January 2005,10,"I've seen this movie in 2004. When I watched the Oscars I didn't want them to win because of that stupid relation between Argentineans and Brazilians. But when I saw it I said: ""Oh my god, what a movie"". I'm really upset now because the MUST won those Oscars. This is an incredible movie. I've never seen and edition like this since ""The Godfather II"". The edition is fantastic. The director(s) have a very particular signature with this movie: you see it and you know it's theirs. The actors were also brilliant. The photography and post production are also incredible. The script is really well written. I give it a 10 and I believe we'll have to wait long until a movie like this."
Good Movie,abdullahsakibg,5 September 2021,8,"If anyone like gangster type movie, they can watch this movie. The plot of the movie is different. But this movie is not that extraordinary as people say. This movie is an one time watch. Anybody will enjoy the movie while watching but this movie don't make an impact on the life."
Why not in Florida?,k0k1,24 January 2003,10,This is a great movie. A real treat! Yes it is violent and yes it is true this is what makes this movie so special.... Most actors are real slum kids... no drama classes involved and still PURE emotion on screen.... AMAZING>>>> TOO BAD IS NOT WIDE RELEASED>>>> WILL IT EVER COME TO MIAMI?
Realistic and honest,kimberlymendez,30 November 2015,9,"City of God captures the brutal life that is lived in the hoods of Brazil. From the beginning of Rockets flashbacks, you see the poverty that surrounds everyone; the small shorts worn with shirts that barely cover their stomachs or don't even have a shirt, the small houses crammed together that are falling apart, rusted old cars, and the run down shops shape the poverty of the town. There were only two ways to get out of it. One, leave the City Of God, but that's virtually impossible, as seen when Benny was preparing to leave but was shot. The other way, become part of the drug world and get to the the top. This is what Lil' Ze did, and what all children aspire to do. Ze, like many other boys, saw how violence and drugs would give people 'great' lives from a young age. Ze demonstrates how this lifestyle of a drug dealer ultimately is not your rise, but actually your fall. He was born in violence and died in violence. But the brutally honest part isn't in the amount of violence seen throughout the entire movie, it is the last scene that truly captures the horrors of the City of God. The kids that killed Ze, were now 'in charge' of the business that all kids want to be in, and as they walk away with guns in their hands talking about making a blacklist of all the people they are going to kill, you realize that this vicious cycle never ends. History will keep repeating itself over and over again with the next generation, and unless you have greater dreams in life like Rocket, you will become what everyone does, a drug consumed man controlled by violence."
the #1 MUST SEE film of Latin America,rachelbh32,19 May 2011,10,"In the first sixty seconds of the film, there are more than seventy camera cuts moving between sharpening knives, chickens, vegetables, musical instruments, and other abrupt scenes. Director, Walter Salles effectively introduces the audience to the tension and constant sentiment of impending danger in the City of God with the fast-paced cuts of images and sound."
"""City of God""",abigail-sawyer,13 May 2011,9,"This film adaptation of Paulo Lins' novel has become one of the best foreign movies ever made. ""City of God"" is the name of one of the most notoriously violent slums that surround Rio de Janeiro. This movie was shot on location in the dangerous Rio favelas (slums). The casting does a good job showing the diversity of those living in the slums. Many of the actors actually grew up in the favelas. Luis Otávio, who is from the ""City of God"" itself, plays the main character Buscapé/Rocket."
Fabulous,r-albury,24 May 2011,10,"Fabulous movie! Probably one of the best I've ever seen. It is a whirlwind tour of the City of God and the back streets and alleyways of Rio de Janeiro. Salles creates characters that draw the audience in and a plot that keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat throughout the entire film. The main character, Buscapé, carries the story through all of the little storyline changes and different perspectives. The movie is very true to life and that makes it approachable for the audience and you feel as if you are part of the movie – feeling what the characters feel and feeling anger, sorrow and sympathy on their behalf. This is definitely a film that I would recommend to anyone."
Unmissable,nikhilrampal,2 January 2018,9,What amazes me about this film is the structure and directing which elevates an already outstanding true story to one of the greatest pieces of film making out there.
A True Classic,tours-72388,2 May 2017,9,"A film so brutally realistic, I was almost surprised to see acting credits at the end. Beautifully shot and wonderfully conveyed, City of God is one for the ages. The main actor gave a heartfelt performance as a young man who somehow manged to maintain hope and determination despite wading through the daily torments of life in the horrific slams of Brazil. Loyal friends, an enthralling love interest and his dreams of a better life, sustain him in this modern masterpiece. Great directing."
Simply Amazing,Samuel-Maldonado,25 May 2011,10,"One of my favorite movies from Brazil! Completely engrossing, with beautiful camera work and a nail-biting plot, Cidade de Deus tells the heart-racing story of a youth from the slums of Brazil trying to make it as a photographer – and just trying to survive. Each character brings his own contribution to the story, the viewer forms strong bonds with many and an extreme distaste for others – it is like being transported into their world. And any time that happens, I consider it a whopping success. The movie also has a huge message about why things happen, how the cycle of violence gets perpetuated to each new generation. An important movie, as well as entirely engrossing: Cidade de Deus is simply amazing."
Deus of a Film,jasonsurety,23 June 2004,10,"City of God is a vivid, compelling work of art.  Not only do directors Katia Lund and Fernando Meirelles tell an amazing coming of age story, but they also graphically display the violence and danger of life in the slums of Rio.  This is a place where one certainly does not have to look for trouble to find it.  Children grow up with a gun in their hand and a nonexistent conscience.  School and work are frivolous activities reserved for the weak and meek.  Hoodlums, as they are called, can become revered for their crimes and ""getting out"" is something frequently discussed but rarely done."
"Beautiful, Brutal, Wonderful, Creative",runninggnome,4 January 2014,10,"This is my first ever review, combine that with the fact I'm talking about a film considered to be modern day classic for which I'm almost certain everything that needs to be said about this movie has already been done so. Be that as it may I wanted to write a review and this is one of my favourite movies to date. So on to the movie. The movie unfolds with an almost constant narrative by the main character 'Rocket' A young photographer who grew up in and around the slums of Brazil. The story he tells chronicles the events that took place affecting him, his family and his friends growing up. Much of the story details the violent rise and fall of several gang hoodlums from their childhood to (in some cases) their deaths. Fernando Meirelles delivers beautiful cinematography, capturing amazing detailed believable environments with excellent use of extras (many of whom actually live in the slums)creating a thriving busy Brazil, best exampled in the leaving party club scene. In my opinion this movie is close to perfect, a brutal depiction of Brazilian slums wonderfully acted and creatively captured. Hows that for a short cliché review? Facts not opinion :)"
Very Good Movie!!,thmurphy-37414,22 September 2016,10,"Out of all the movies made outside of the United States that I have seen, The City of God is by far the best. It is so interesting how easily everyone is allowing violence in their lives. It also seems like all of the older people are able to see past the drugs and focus on making their living through an actual career. Especially since no one would live long enough to be older than 50 as a drug dealer in Rio. As they would eventually be shot, or taken over, which would also lead to them being shot. It was also interesting how big of a role masculinity is to everyone in the City of God. They believe you become a man when you kill and do drugs, yet that just turns you down the wrong path, which leads to death. The age group for the drug dealers and everyone else associated with the business is anywhere from 6 to 40. A main theme in the movie was love, as Benny, Lil' Ze's best friend is going to leave the slums with his girlfriend and go live on a farm. He is shortly killed, and then the girl instantly leaves the area and is never seen in the movie ever again. I have no idea where she went, but she was also the main girl in Rocket's eyes. The main character who eventually earns an internship at the paper as a photographer for taking pictures of LIl' Ze and his gang. The movie was very focused on death as well, as someone was dying every 5 minutes, or someone was doing drugs every 5 minutes. Rocket stays out of the drug war and only smokes marijuana, as everyone else is doing cocaine and shooting everyone else. It is a very happy ending for Rocket, but not so much for all of the drug dealers, as they are all killed and the ""Runts"" take over the drug business in the end."
Unforgettable,omouallem,26 July 2004,9,"City of God's central story revolves around two opposing drug-rings in the title city. These two rings, although related to one-another, divide the city in tyranny, gangs, wealth, power and in the end moral stance. These rings are run by Little Ze and Carrot, two hoods who have grown up murdering, stealing, and influencing others. Each ring is composed of kids, (infants really) teens, and young adults, all waiting to become the next Lord of their city."
Amazing,sveniverson,31 March 2010,10,"This movie is now #17 on Imdbs all time list of greatest movies, and deservedly so. It is a realistic and gripping view of gang activity in Brazils, Rio De Janero. The realism is brought out by the amazing performances of the authentic and unknown actors."
Excellent Brazilian epic covering gangs,KoalaBear33,23 September 2002,10,City of God is a Brazilian film that chronicles the formation of gangs in poor neighbourhoods of Rio de Janerio. The film is based on a true story and is an epic covering around 30 years. The story is told via the overlapping lives of several children who grow up to be gangsters. The film is very violent (most violent movie I have seen) so some might be turned off by it. The script is very good and the acting is great (this is remarkable considering how most of the actors are non-professionals hired from these same neighbourhoods).
City of Goodfellas!!,Andyeightyseven,1 March 2006,10,"I was sceptical when i first sat down and watched this film for the first time. Basically because i have never really been into foreign films, with all the western films being thrown into our faces with English as the main language. However i sat down and watched it, after hearing that this was similar to Goodfellas and many people saying that it is actually a better film!! i thought no way!!."
Crazy good but intense movie,olrovin,21 September 2016,9,"This movie shocked and disturbed me, made me laugh, and even made me cry. Throughout the film, I felt a roller-coaster of emotions because it was packed with such complex human interactions and feelings. I hated all the violence, but I understand why it was necessary to be a part of the movie. The 60s and 70s in Rio and its slums were a crazy time full of violence and serious gang issues. The violence shown in the film added to the raw reality of the film, showed the craziness of the time period, and also helped to created empathy for some of the characters. I loved all the techniques that the director used to tell the story like the quick frames, split screens, photo lens, and backtracking. It really made the visual aspect of the movie very interesting and added a new layer to it. My favorite character by far was Rocket because he was a good kid who tried to stay out of the violence. All he really wanted to do was to take pictures, and I like how he used his unfortunate situation to help progress his future photography career. I would highly recommend this movie mostly because of the amazing story it tells and the artistry with which it is told."
La Ciudad del Diablo,cacrawford-60825,22 September 2016,10,"Everything about this movie was great, from the acting, to the camera shots, and the plot in general. I really enjoyed how the movie was told in the POV of Rocket, but also told every main characters story individually. One of my favorite parts of the movie was where they first found Knockout Ned on the bus, but then Rocket narrated that ""It wasn't time to talk about him yet. Another interesting part of this movie was watching the City of God evolve over the years. The city started as a dusty little town, but then evolved into a full on favela. Another key evolution in this movie was Lil' Ze's rise to power. He started off as a wannabe from the slums, and eventually became the most powerful gang leader in the City of God. A very powerful scene was the montage of Lil' Ze killing people. The POV of the camera was of the person on the ground being shot, and it showed Lil' Ze above you, holding a gun. Every time the gun would go off, the scene would change, and every time the scene would change, Lil' Ze would keep getting older and older. Overall, the use of Point of View and camera angles in this movie really helped to enhance the symbolism and gang violence in this movie."
Very accurate movie,pacoundouriotis,22 September 2016,,"For starters, I really liked a lot of things about this movie. One of my favorite things was how the movie was Rocket explaining everything. I liked how he narrated the movie as the movie showed what he was talking about. I also liked how each time it introduced a character, it amused and said their name while the camera was looking at them. I also liked how the movie was split into different ""chapters"" sort of. For example, the last one was called ""The Beginning of the End."" I thought Rocket's story was very inspiring. I like how he didn't join any of the gangs and still managed to be successful and land a job that's he was passionate about. I also really liked Benny. He was by far my favorite character. He gave off a really positive and friendly vibe. I strongly disliked Lil' Zé. One concept that I thought was very interesting was the fact that Benny and Lil' Zé coexisted. I thought it was good symbolism like the fight between good and evil. Benny was good, Lil' Zé was evil. Something that made me happy was the fact that a gang of toddlers killed Lil' Zé. I found it funny how such a powerful, intimidating, and influential character like Lil' Zé, got killed by toddlers. One thing I like about this movie was how in depth it portrayed the drug scene in Brazil. I also found it shocking how at the end, there was a band of kids just walking through the street with their guns out in the open and no one stopped them. I have a feeling that that group of people will become the next Lil' Zé gang."
A true story beyond Shakespearian tragedy...,glorysails,16 September 2006,10,Turns out it was a true story. I would not have known until the last few seconds of the film.
Good Work,hualalalamima,20 July 2020,8,"Not only guns, photography can also change life. Bloody violence, the law of the jungle and a Rio that doesn't appear on postcards at all. The editing flows like a samba."
I couldn't take my eyes off the screen,vivacco,11 February 2005,,"I just saw City of God late last night. I don't think I'd ever even heard about this film before seeing it. What a surprise! Let me tell you, this is without a doubt one of the best movies I've ever seen. It jumps out and grabs your attention right from the very first frame of film. The backdrop, the images, the directing, the acting...all incredible! Watching the acting, I thought to myself ""this is amazing how well they are acting."" I suspected that most if not all the people they used in the film really did grow up in that environment. They just acted too good. They were just too natural with it."
The Incredible World and Story of City of God,itssamsonbro,12 March 2016,9,"City of God is a story of a young man seeking refuge in a world that is full of violence and hatred through the lens of a camera. And I say ""world"" and not city because when you are watching this movie, it doesn't even seem like a real place in our world. It seems like a made up land that is full of unbelievable stories. But it is all based on a true story, which totally amazed me when i found it out at the end of the movie. The only down side was that the plot caught a hold of me and kept me hooked, reeling me in for a great climactic ending. But when i got to the ending, I was sort of let down because it didn't seem satisfying or to be what I had hoped and expected for. But that was before I realized it was all based on true accounts, and that was when i was completely shocked. All in all, the movie is great and is a fantastic way to expand your world, showing you a place that you thought couldn't possibly exist."
GREAT FILM!!! ****,ObsessiveViewer,11 June 2004,,*-Catch it on TV **-Worth a Rental ***-Buy it Used ****-Worthy of a Blind Buy
Viva Brazil! Wonderful to see Originality.,mitru,6 February 2004,,"This is a foreign film that comes from Brazil. It's about the ghettos outside Brazil, where the area called City of God is divided in half by the two drug cartels... how they rose and fell as the thirst for power and revenge grew. It's a sad story mostly because it was a true story. The cinematography was amazing. I recommend this to anyone who's fond of subtitled foreign films. It will give you a glimpse of something you haven't seen in a long time... originality."
City of God,magonzalez-15762,22 September 2016,9,"City of God was a wonderful movie to watch. It was a thrilling experience to see and it had me on the edge of my seat. I enjoyed the camera angles of the film as well as the entire plot. I found it interesting that the scenes would jump from one period in time to a completely different period. Also, I liked when the camera would show two different scenes going on at the same time before they converged into one scene. It was also strange to see how many scenes included drugs or sex. I did enjoy the character's of both Benny and Rocket. Benny was the kind of guy that everybody liked and I found myself growing attached to him. I had the same feeling with Rocket. He was a man of convictions who wanted to obtain his goal of becoming a photographer no matter what it took."
Una maravilla,memoch2008,27 April 2021,10,No se cuantas veces la he visto. Me parece genial y nunca me canso de verla.
Romantic of Brazil ghetto,andreysus-28290,19 January 2022,9,"A lot of muscular, textured black guys. At first, you confuse the characters, because of their race, but it won't last long. You can still guess what their beauty is, but when it is claimed that one of them is much more beautiful than the second, you think: ""And how do you understand that?"" However, after half an hour they seem completely different and quite characteristic. All things bear the imprint of strictly local specifics, because of this, the picture looks like a small trip to unknown lands."
A haunting look at life in a Brazilian slum town,raop74,29 November 2003,9,"This is a movie that stays with you for a long time.  Beautifully directed, perfectly paced, and with a very realistic cast of actors (maybe a little too real at times).  It's a brutal, cruel, and darkly funny film."
City of Violent Children with Weapons,anthimus_k,15 August 2003,8,"Excellent performances by every person in this movie, that this is based on true story ""is almost hard to believe""."
Near perfection,Colin0001,20 November 2004,10,"This film crept up on me, and snatched away my personal prize of 'Best Film' that I'd years before awarded to another. But it deserves it. With pathos, humour, violence, necessary betrayal, and many other parts to its whole - it is astonishing. I was dumbfounded by how effortlessly this masterpiece unfolded before me. The only shame of making a film like this is how do you follow it? Well it seems a made-for-TV sequel is how you do it. Shame, but when a big film/TV studio offers megabucks to cash in on the fame of the original, it must've been impossible to turn away. Still, I have seen a lot of films over the last few years and nothing quite beats this. I cannot fault it at all - except that it did have to end. I know I'm fawning in my shameless praise, but it is the one recent film I can think of that I could rate as a '10'."
Strong and straight,buntyonline,10 May 2014,8,"A exploratory viewpoint on stories about life of slum dwellers' midst the power, violence and mainly drugs in Rio de Janeiro, the capital city of Brazil. Surprisingly this gem is the finest jewel of the rather unknown director duos. Based on true events, the casting director has done a tremendous job in getting the actors who a lot like their real life counterparts. Fantastic direction and equally good actors. You can see what the upcoming splurge capital goes through. Even though it's shiny on the outside, there's still dirt (city's slum and drug infestation) underneath. The realism is high. The narration is superb. It'll be a good and enjoyable challenge for you to connect the dots as the story progresses. Strongly recommended."
"Two young men take different paths, and learn how to live in the slums, one uses his passion to escape, and the other does not.",sunnysarasota,22 September 2016,8,"This film was very intriguing to watch, and got me thinking of why certain scenes and parts of the movie were shown in a specific way. In the beginning of the film I was confused, because it showed the ending part of the scene, and then went back to the beginning, and told the story. The way that it changed from ending to beginning, and then replayed that scene at the end made this film very unique, and some American films are similar, but what makes this different than most American films is the language, and shows life in a different country during the 60's and 70's , and how the people there were living like, so I got to see a different perspective. Throughout this film, it talked about each character describing them, and went back and forth, which I thought was very distinctive. My favorite character in this film would be Rocket, because he did not agree with his friends and ""acquaintances"" in that they were involved in a gang and committing lots of crimes, and were doing drugs. Rocket found something that he was very passionate of, and that was photography. He used that in a way to escape the gang life, and separated himself of those bad ""acquaintances"". Even though he was there at the time of when shootings were going on, he tried to stay away from violence, by not actually killing anyone, and this showed who he was as a person. I would recommend watching this film if you like inspiring stories, or want to see an international film that will teach and narrate a unique story from a different perspective."
great film,logatherum,25 September 2016,,"This was one of my favorite movies we've watched thus far. I really thought that the acting was so well done, and the scenes were filmed really nicely, and were pleasing to the eye. my favorite scene was probably when the whole group of teens were at the beach, and Rocket was jealous of Tiago, since he wished he was dating his girlfriend at the time, Angelica. Then, I thought it was really neat when Angelica dumped him for Rocket, and I felt happy for him that he got the girl of his dreams. My favorite character was Benny, because although he was associated with Lil Ze, he was, in Lil Z's words ""too nice"". He would let people off easy, which showed his sensitive side, as well as when he fell in love and decided he was going to leave the violence behind for ""his girl"", rock music, and a farm. Benny was really the only main character that I really felt sad about when he was shot, since he was so different from everyone else, as he seemed to be more human. I felt badly for Angelica as well, as they really wanted to get their life back on track together, and grow old. My least favorite character was Lil Ze, because he was just simply the ""bad guy"" of the film. I did however, have a bit of sympathy for him because his insecurities showed when he'd try and let loose. For example, whenever he tried to talk to girls, and he was rejected, you could tell how insecure that made him. I really disliked how instead of stopping to pursue the woman, he'd just force them into sex and assault them one way or another. I would give this movie five out of five stars."
Cidade de Deus: A Piece of Cinematic Brilliance!!,anusince87,11 February 2010,10,"Cidade de Deus (City of God) based on the ghettos of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil is a GEM of Brazilian cinema. It is right at the top of my top 10 movies list. It is very much comparable to other very acclaimed Gangster movies like ""The Godfather"", ""Goodfellas"" and ""Pulp Fiction""."
A truly remarkable piece of 'real' cinema,RadicalTintin,29 January 2003,8,"Meirelles viewed first hand the destructive lives of the citizens of the City of God, and his appreciation of their difficult existence is evident from this supreme piece of Brazilian film-making. The story flows fluidly as we follow the lives of young residents of this harsh social domain. The use of 'real' people to fill major roles in the movie is a piece of inspired cinema, with exact, mesmerising performances from the young stars. True, it is violent and very dark, but there are moments of black comedy that make this 'coming of age' tale highly watchable. It is as unpredictable as it is compelling and the film editing belongs in a masterclass of its own. Superb."
That is the true!,alexlaradiniz,11 March 2004,,"I watched ""City of God"" and I remembered a scene from ""Robocop 2"", when the movie tried to shock us showing some kids robbering a shop wearing baseball shirts. Now I am laughing about that stupid scene, it was so unreal..! So different about that scene that shows a child being encouraged to shot another one in ""City of God"": that is real! Some people did some heavy critics for the movie of Fernando Meirelles because of the violence, but it is true, that is real! Brazil still have problems like this, it is a mix of the pooverty of Africa and the power of some strong economies of Europe. Despite of these, in defense of my country, I can say that we are a very talented people with a very good future appearing at the horizon..."
Bold and Suspenseful,franco3,20 June 2013,8,"City of God is certainly one of the most exceptional foreign language films in movie history! The movie excels in every level. The captivating camera shots make a truly fascinating cinematography. Editing was brilliantly done with some Pulp Fiction influence added into it. No single actor's performance particularly outshine the most, but the ensemble performance, from the street kids to the crime masterminds, is remarkably convincing! The screenwriter made the story so suspenseful, bold and daring, that you would not want to miss a single scene. And the truly best aspect of the movie is its ingenious film making. Watch out for the ""apartment scene"" where the genius director shows how one small apartment drastically transforms as its inhabitants change through the years."
Beautifully chasing the chicken,kebman,14 December 2003,9,"So, let's talk about violence; of which there is a great deal in this film. Unlike so many Hollywood films, where violence seem to take a recreational dimension, this film really gets to you. It makes you think twice about it, since it doesn't present dead bodies, but dead persons. A big difference in my book."
A stylish tragedy...shocking but stunning,mezaco,20 March 2004,9,(this may contain some spoilers)
Dissenting Opinion,Jacobdk,18 June 2003,6,"With nothing but rousing praise leading me into the theater, I should have expected such a disappointingly inauthentic and stylistically inappropriate film.  City of God is not half as depressing as others suggest, or as it should be, and the dialogue throughout is embarrassingly generic.  It had a glossy texture with doses of disturbing violence mixed into a mostly nostalgic and derivative coming of age story.  While I was never bored - there's certainly no lack of action or story telling energy - I never felt connected to these one-dimensional characters (except sometimes Benny).  People are introduced and killed off before we could ever feel emotionally connected to them (in this way the comparison to Pulp Fiction is valid, though Pulp Fiction was PULP, and this is supposed to be a meaningful film about the plight of street kids in Rio).  Overall, it's a big budget after school special. For a real film on the subject check out Bunuel's Los Olvidados."
Gorgeous!,tiagoabreu2007,28 March 2018,10,"This movie is a real gem. It is about as near perfection as any movie can be. The story and writing are superb, with fantastic direction, and the acting is amazing. Really the entire cast is impeccable. I can't recommend this one highly enough. The only warning I have is that it obviously is not good for family/children viewing because of the violence and subject matter involved. But what a great story and movie this is! Riveting."
"A stunning, harsh, and beautiful look at life in a favela",bjmorrissett,10 January 2013,10,"Well-off countries have a habit of sweeping the issues of small countries under the rug, unless helping them can benefit us. Some movies like to give you a look at what you're unaware of in the harshest way possible, and jam the issue into your face until you feel bad for not helping people in these conditions. This what City of God tries to do, and it succeeds admirably. Everything about this movie works to make it more powerful. The acting, the story telling, the directing, all make you feel like you're living in this world of filth, crime, and poverty. Many of the actors in this movie were actually from The City of God, a very crime-ridden and poor part of the Rio Favela. They embody their roles well because of this. They do a wonderful job of making small parts into interesting characters. Another crucial part is the story-telling. The movie is filled with flashbacks that give characters back-stories. These serve to not only inflate the narrative, but they help make memorable characters. The movie also juggles several stories at once, but manages to keep your attention and understanding. For instance, the final scenes deal with Rocket trying to further his photography career, Carrot and Li'l Ze going to war, a young boy killing Knockout Ned for murdering his father,the police being corrupt, and the Runts taking over. All of this happening at once helps to absorb you into the action on screen But the most important part, in my opinion, is the directing. Fernando Meirelles and Katia Lund did a truly amazing job of filming even slower scenes to make them seem fast-paced and intense. The way some shots are done are inventive and almost fun to watch, much like the work of Sam Raimi. This makes the movie seem frantic and energetic the whole way through. So, this movie that I can't understand a word of and I bought for 3$ at my local video store impressed me beyond words. It quickly took a slot in my top 10 favorite movies, and should be regarded as one of the best foreign films of all times."
"Excellent, raw movie!",adolph70,24 April 2003,,"What a great piece of filmmaking. I was drawn in to the plot, the characters...it being a true story only heightened the atmosphere. Enthralling, to say the least! Goes to show what we're missing in N. America thanks to Hollywood. And for everyone who didn't like the bluntness or thought we learned nothing from it, well then maybe u want to watch yet ANOTHER war movie. They all have awards under their belt anyways...knock yourself out."
A film to admire of a subject to despair,Bel Ludovic,27 September 2003,10,"(spoilers) It doesn't take long for the irony inherent in the City of God's name to become apparent. This is an unflinching portrait of gang warfare in a Brazilian favela. It is a place crippled by competition for drug turf and in that competition life is shockingly worthless. Gun-squeamish viewers will not enjoy this film, as one of the key protagonists, Li'l Ze, emerges as one of cinema's most evil characters, dispensing with both ally and enemy with the carelessness of a child throwing away sweet wrappers. Any hope gleaned from the narrator, Rocket's, escape into a better world is diminished by the ease with which the baton of violence and worthlessness is passed onto the next generation at an age young enough for them to still be wetting their beds. Taut direction, fearless acting and beautiful cinematography make this a classic, but one that leaves the viewer in despair."
A vivid movie about hope and despair in Brazil's slums,lduperval,20 June 2004,8,"Brazil's National Office of Tourism must have been non too pleased about this film. As a Northern suburbanite, to me Brazil has always meant soccer, samba and bossa nova. If I were to pick three destinations for a trip, Brazil would be right up there. Before seeing this movie, that is."
Buy the DVD,csands,28 January 2005,10,"Buy the movie, watch it, and then watch the special feature. It is UNREAL. I mean it gave me goosebumps and brought tears to my eyes. The documentary is absolutely unbelievable. I don't just mean that in the sense that everyone else uses the word, I mean that it is literally UNBELIEVABLE. I had no idea that this kind of thing was going on in the everyday world of some people. I sat there and watched the documentary in disbelief. Please, watch this. It will change your whole understanding of the world and the suffering and violence that goes on (The movie is quite incredible as well. It has great cinematography, it reminds me of Snatch-it tells one story and then goes back in time somewhat to tell a parallel story)."
Pleasantly Surprised,david-553-388956,8 January 2016,9,"I hadn't heard that much about this movie before I saw it. But I think that was a good thing. When I saw it I didn't have any expectations, which is rare when you are in to movies. Usually I look up a lot of information about the movie, watch the trailer a multiple times."
Well Documented reality,ashishsureshbhosle,21 August 2021,10,"Watched this movie in 2021 & still amazed by the direction background score & flawless acting of each & every actor, looks like they've not shot this movie they actually lived it! Hats off to the makers & performers ! Loved it!"
Amazing period piece / crime movie,drew-malinowski,10 August 2019,10,"While this movie is primarily a crime movie, it largely serves as a period piece for Rio in the 60s - 80s"
Close to a Masterpiece,marc-151,31 October 2002,10,"I saw some incredible films at the Toronto Film Festival this year, but this was the best."
WOW!,mutcutts,9 August 2003,10,"Very few films capture true chaos.  I saw City of God in a art house theatre in Benton Harbor, MI.  It was Ebert's #2 movie of the year, so that enough intrigued me.  I heard it was violent, unflinching, and powerful.  Those words don't even come close to describing this film.  City of God stuck with me long after I walked out of the theatre, there are moments that are just UN-FU****-BELIEVEABLE.  See this film.  It made my all-time top 10 and that's saying a lot."
"unrelenting, unbelievable",mutcutts,4 June 2003,10,"City of God is one of those rare films that doesn't pull back at the moment of truth.  This is the most violent, gritty film I've seen in a long time. A masterfully told story surrounded by interesting, complicated characters. This is the best film of 2002."
Superb!!!,electrobird,13 February 2004,10,"I grew up in Rio and the violence on those projects and slums was common place on the news. As a matter of fact, both violence and misery are toned down on the screen. It strikes me much more than Tarrantino's or Scorcese's because I know it is FOR REAL!  I remember well during the 80's when drug dealer Bolado from the Rocinha slum was killed: His murderer was burnt alive with the gasoline from his own motorcycle, later they blown his head away with a shotgun to make him stop yelling."
Bang Bang,r-mcharg,11 October 2003,9,"POSSIBLE TINY SPOILER ALERT when i first read about CITY OF GOD, Colin Kennedy of Empire magazine said it was more or less in the same class as GOODFELLAS. he isn't too far off. although unlike most reviewers i don't think the movie is great because it shows the harshness of the slum, i think it is brilliant because it is so damn entertaining. it has a tragic lining of course but the story, through its music and reasonably happy ending is rather upbeat. whatever you read or think about CITY OF GOD just watch it again and again and again. you'll thank yourself for it."
One of the best films I've ever seen,harunmushod,16 January 2003,10,"I saw this at the London Film Festival in November. It made the whole festival for me. The comparisons with Goodfellas and Amores Perros are deserved, although I preferred it to the latter film. The subject matter - the lives of street level gang members over a period  of time and the editing and story telling style are similar to Goodfellas. I just can't believe that most of the actors are not professionals."
City Of God,fey-rock22,2 July 2013,,"un, don't walk, to the cinema is all I can say. This electrifying picture is part tender coming-of-age film and part gang-warfare epic from the Brazilian slum, or favela, told from the viewpoint of the children who manage to be both its underclass and its criminal overlords. It's a movie with all the dials cranked up to 11, an overwhelming, intoxicating assault on the senses, and a thriller so tense that you might have the red seat plush in front of you - or even some unfortunate's hair - gripped in both fists."
Very strong movie. Acting and story is top class,matsolsson,30 October 2003,10,"You keep thinking about this movie for days after you've seen it. It is a little bit like a Tarantino movie, except that this one is for real. The violence is there right in your face throughout the movie, but it is not cool, it is just awful."
How does this film have an 8.6!?,obrienh-00674,13 October 2021,4,The fact that this film has such great reviews makes me like it even less. The script is just poor. The dialogue is awful and I found myself getting more and more bored as it went on. There is no emotion whatsoever. Characters get the bare minimum of development before meeting a brutal end. And the writers repeat this throughout the film. There is simply nothing about this film that I could latch on to in order to keep me engaged. If you're expecting a masterpiece as the 8.6 rating suggests then you're going to be underwhelmed.
OMG This movie is insane you will love it,smoothie786,10 October 2005,10,this movie is insane and one of the best movies i have every seen. It is unbelievable yet so true and so real. A real shock. You have to watch this movie it is one of the best movies you will ever watch.
"Proves that poverty, crime and drugs come along with moral degradation",tomreves,4 February 2011,10,"One of the excellent movies ever made, deserving 18th place in the IMDb TOP 250 movies list."
"""Fight and you'll never survive...Run and you'll never escape.""",Haynerator,15 February 2009,9,"Based on true events of a Brazilian slum in Rio de Janeiro, 'City of God' tells a harrowing tale of one boys fight to escape poverty and crime. Over the course of roughly two decades, the story is told through the eyes of our young protagonist; 'Rocket', who desperately wants to make something of himself and free himself from the violence, drugs, robberies and corruption of the 'City of God'."
Easily One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made,tluke25,6 March 2007,10,The movie FLOORED me! Without a doubt one of the greatest films ever. I will guarantee even Spielberg and Scorsese completely flipped out when they seen this.
"Seriously good film, it's ""foreignness"" is IRRELEVANT",natty-94145,17 May 2018,10,"Seriously good film, it's ""foreignness"" is IRRELEVANT"
The New Master of the Pen Camera.,Au-Cinema,4 December 2002,,"The first half hour of ""City of God"" shocks us because of the subject matter and the style in which the director tells his story and puts it on-screen."
Well worth it; extremely compelling,dylan-grieve,30 May 2011,9,"City of God was a gritty, voyeuristic glimpse into a lifestyle far different than that experienced by those of us from industrialized societies. The camera shots were done in a very raw fashion, giving the film a realistic quality. Every smudge on the walls, every close glimpse at the sweat and grime on someone's face; it all jumped out as though I were right there."
Two boys grow up in the City of God and teach you a lesson in life and film-making.,tackledspoon,25 February 2005,10,"After watching this movie, not only was I stunned at the events that took place, but struck by a much more superficial thought. People like editors and cinematographers don't get enough credit. People always laud the director for his great accomplishments, but the average person doesn't realize how much of what they call direction is actually edition and cinematography, two things this movie is near perfect in. The shots are so perfectly composed and angled. They put you in a perfect perspective from which to view the movie, be it the eyes of the narrator or some omnicient bystander between a killer and his victim in an alleyway. The editing takes advantage of every moment, strobing during a tense fight or slowing the film just a bit, pausing movement and panning around so that you can see an entire scene. The control of situation is excellent. While much of that is owed to direction, I think that the cinematography and editing, aside from the great writing, acting and content, are what makes this movie for me. 10/10"
Great Film with many twists,magilroy,5 December 2016,6,"In City of God, directed by Fernando Meirelles, the idea of choices matter is very important. In the beginning of the film, the narrator, later revealed as Rocket, glorifies the trouble that is caused in a small city by his brother and two friends who were known as The Tender Trio. These three older boys would steal from gasoline trucks and other places, while causing no harm. One night, one of the Tender Trio brings their brother, known then as Li'l Dice, along on one of their missions and is instructed to stand watch. While the three nonviolent, older boys go into the motel and make a fortune, Li'l Dice satisfied his taste for blood by killing a majority of the people inside the motel after the brothers leave. After the aftermath, none of the Tender Trio survives the police brutality and the movie moves a few years into the future. Rocket then tells the story of L'il Ze. Rocket, who is fascinated with photography, chooses the path of a nonviolent bystander. L'il Dice, now known as L'il Ze, is a violent drug lord who kills without pity. From the guns to drugs to war, Rocket continues to show how he becomes a rising photographer and how the drug war breaks out in the City of God. In the end, Rocket becomes a famous photographer for all his action shots and exclusives in the drug war in the City of God. This movie appeals to many emotions has it builds up the viewer's attachment to characters in order to make a lasting feel when those characters are killed. I would recommend this movie to hardy individuals who do not become too attached to characters."
City Of God - Cinematic Masterpiece,vengatesh-74587,24 October 2018,10,"One of the finest Crime-Drama movies ever made....Fernando Meirelles done a wondeful job at directing....Cinematography was mind-blowing, well done César Charlone....Casting was good and Memorable Characters, especially Rocket, Li' l zé, Knockout Ned and Benny were awesome, Screen-Writer Bráulio Mantoveni done a extra-ordinary job...film editing was great, Musical Score was melded beautifully with the film...Damn, i can do this all day....well, let me make it simply....One of the greatest movies ever made."
"Perfectly portrays the slum culture , their struggles , and path to success.",ujandeyk,23 May 2020,9,"No famous cast, no great music, only a movie worth a watch.
The story is about the members(mainly 2 of them) of a small gang of a Brazilian slum, how they end up in life, and their story.
There is violence, drugs, revenge, and what not. This is truly an underrated piece of art."
MTV Neo-realism,carlos.virgile-3,15 November 2002,9,"""Cidade de Deus""is without a shadow of a doubt a worthy film. Judging by today's cinema standards it is rather unusual. Life in the Rio favelas and the struggle for survival of its inhabitants don't come first to mind as the ideal formula pitch for the latest Hollywood blockbuster. A quote of reality is these days extremely shocking and, funnily enough, a welcomed relief from our culture general lack of content and genuine disinterest in reflecting anything too uncomfortable to watch with the exception of cheap and easy-to-digest thrills."
one of the best,manoj-mack,5 February 2016,9,"I would say this is one of the best movie I ever seen. when you talk about cinematography, editing and story etc."
City of God,Bdot2187,7 December 2008,,"The city of God is one of the best best films that I have ever seen. This film is about the true story of the violent slums of Rio de Janeiro aka city of God. The screenplay was well done because the film has so much stories with in it, different characters and places have their on tale to tell. The main character telling the story from his point of view and it goes back and forth through time. The story kept me interested the whole entire film, there isn't any part of the film where I felt bored or confused. In this film the director wanted to give people a little taste of what it would be like living in the city of God and he wants to show the vivid violence. Being that the story starts out with gangsters running the town and new people always taking the last gangsters place. The director wants to say that this will never end, it only repeats. This unique film had some great cinematography, and the acting was really good. In one scene where a little boy was shot in the foot for stealing in the slums, he cried so much and it looked so real as if he were really hurt. The setting was amazing, many daylight shots where people were brutally murdered in the daytime. The director successful makes this film to have an effect on people."
In my top 10,katyabeck,27 May 2008,9,I was thinking about a blog I wrote recently with my top ten movies of all time. My curiosity led me to check out where IMDb rates this movie. I was pleased to see that others enjoyed this as well.
Such a well put together movie.,drhupp,22 September 2016,10,"This movie was so full of suspense and I was always trying to guess what was coming next. I was even able to guess correctly a few times, pure luck I must say. The way the movie started with the ""legendary"" three gangsters was really cool. Yes, the three were bad, but they never wanted to kill anyone. They only used their guns for hold ups, no killings. That was the case until a crazy little gangster named Lil Dice joined the gang and immediately went on a killing spree. Why did he do this? Because he was psychopath, that's basically it. After the three gangsters had either been killed or left to have new lives, Lil Dice moved the Rio. From here on he was able to conquer the slum killing anyone that annoyed him at all. he was eventually killed by a bunch of little kids that he gave guns to. Ending the legend of Lil Dice."
"Wonderful Story, Fantastic Style",Dwolvesbane,15 December 2008,10,"When listing the world's great film industries it is inevitable that one will mention the United States, India, France, perhaps even Germany and Italy. One nation that is not often mentioned is Brazil, a shame considering films such as City of God. This story of aging and maturing, both of Rocket, the main character, and of the slum known as the City of God itself, is a true masterwork of film making."
"""What we need is more violence on screen.""",ricrisci,21 January 2003,6,"City of God may be a good work of art but if I were to prioritize all such good works to be seen in the world, this would not be near the top. I already live in a world with enough violence and misery around me, so when I go to the theater I prefer to see objects of beauty. The message that senseless violence begets only more senseless violence is a good, if trite, one. But all I could think throughout the film was, ""Who will shoot whom next?"""
One of my favourite movies!,anshianand-57011,24 July 2021,10,Wow. You are left with an unexplained feeling after watching this movie.
Entertaining and informative,mellatron,7 March 2003,,This film was one of the highlights of last years releases. told from a personal viewpoint it chronicles the hazards of growing up against impossible odds. I felt sympathetic towards the characters struggles to improve their lives. What can the authorities expect when the police murder and rob to an equal extent as the gangsters - extreme poverty leads to extreme consequences. Although violent I did not find the film overtly so and the end is frighteningly pessimistic. Thumbs up for this one
Something didn't tell,jmpicasso,14 August 2005,10,Dear brothers and sisters:
The best Brazilian movie I've ever seen,dunkel_berg25,30 September 2002,,"This is the best movie , made in my country, that I have ever seen. And this isn't just a very well made movie, but also very important to society as well. It's  very violent but also very truthful.  The series of stories about Rio de Janeiro's bad neighborhoods on the time of three decades are so well told that I wished for more. It is funny at times, but still a very violent movie. Cause of its fast paced rhythm, and cool sound track, this is must see."
Depressing with a slight ray of hope,ariana6289,15 May 2011,9,"City of God tells the story of two young boys growing up in a violent neighborhood in Rio de Janeiro: Lil Ze who becomes a gangster and Rocket who becomes a photographer. It is not an easy movie to watch as it addresses some very difficult themes. Throughout the film we see horrible gang violence that exists in the world among children as young as five and six years old. The children in the city are exposed to guns and drugs before they even learn how to read and it becomes the only thing they know. The violence and treachery unfold in what is filmed as a party-like atmosphere, creating a palpable sense of indifference among the gangsters for the viewer. The movie was filmed on the streets of Rio with hand-held cameras and a cast that includes many unprofessional actors which makes it appear incredibly authentic, allowing the viewer to understand the reality of the situation. Although the film makes it clear that such a cycle of violence is difficult to escape, it gives the viewer some sense of hope in the resolution of Rocket's story when he proves that escape is a viable possibility."
An ambitious and impressive must see,mauriciofarias,22 September 2015,9,"City of God is a movie that tells a fictional story inspired by the non-fictional book by journalist Paulo Lins, portrayed as the central character, ""Buscapé"" Rocket, and former resident between the 60's and the 70's of the ghetto that shares its name. It develops in a flashback with alternate points of view that disassembles and exposes the parts of the cycle of violence which hasn't yet passed, at least not until the year 2015 when I write this critic. Foreign viewers can compare it to a documentary. For the Brazilian, it offers a production comparable to a great American action movie with good plot, but in a universe with which we can identify. The most shocking scenes can haunt some people for some time, but do not overlap in the movie, being well dosed with funny and uplifting moments. The pace is frenetic. The camera movement is agile and spontaneous, though it seems precisely planned. The soundtrack is a compilation of popular music that must be subtitled in foreign versions to fully justify its part in the movie."
"""City of God""",nicoleakoukouthompson,28 February 2015,10,"""City of God"" was stunning and powerful feature, and it's the film that changed the way that I watch film. Everything about it was stirring and emotional, and it taught me about the realities that other people experience in other nations. The vibrancy of the film is only matched by sharp acting on behalf of the child actors, who deal in violence, survival and power in Brazil. The movie is truly unlike any other I've ever seem, and it's almost insane that the movie, based on the book by Paulo Lins, is based on the writer's life...and his experiences amid the slums of Brazil. This film most certainly deserved to win bigger award than it did because it's a movie that someone can walk away from feeling disturbed, but educated. And that's powerful."
10/10,attilaunderwood,9 April 2021,10,"Brazil, 1960s, City of God. The Tender Trio robs motels and gas trucks. Younger kids watch and learn well...too well. 1970s: Li'l Zé has prospered very well and owns the city. He causes violence and fear as he wipes out rival gangs without mercy. His best friend Bené is the only one to keep him on the good side of sanity. Rocket has watched these two gain power for years, and he wants no part of it. He keeps getting swept up in the madness. All he wants to do is take pictures. 1980s: Things are out of control between the last two remaining gangs...will it ever end? Welcome to the City of God."
Beautifully executed idea,mehmetbozgedik,29 January 2021,9,This was like the director was telling me that 'Just sit back and enjoy the ride'. Please do not watch this piece when you are feeling down and in the mood for something more dull and slow paced.
10,theLRGdon,29 June 2005,10,"wow, this movie is presented very real and done with style. The gritty reality of city of god can be summed up with the shooting of the young child in the foot. with that it becomes very clear that this war extended to everyone, and that moment captivated the crowd into this reality. Then you have the constant hits to the style of the time within the seventies. where it was a time to be ""groovy"", and that is portrayed within Benny, as it gets you captivated into this culture. And yet the conflict with Benny and Lil ze is not mainly what resulted into his death. That feel of the seventies IMO is greatly portrayed within the movie, and sets up a great vibe.A great movie all in all, me being only 15 this is a great movie to see and be able to analyze"
Average. Too violent.,herpaderpa,21 February 2009,4,"After I read all the praise that this movie was getting, being for example entitled as one of the best movies ever made, I had pretty high expectations. Before watching the DVD I did not read anything about the plot. I really didn't know what kind of movie to expect and barely understood what the genre would be. After watching I don't understand why so many people love this film. Totally overrated."
Masterful Execution,evanmarkpirone,28 September 2015,10,"Exhilarating on the first viewing and constantly rewarding there after. City of God epitomizes bold and invigorating storytelling both in its cinematic style and its narrative. The film expertly depicts the chaotic favelas of Rio De Janeiro, a place otherwise referred to as the 'City of God' — ironically so due to its complete lack of justice, laws or sanctity."
nice,mik-blo,16 May 2015,,"The story begins with the early stages of the City of God (in the 1960's) showing where many of the problems stem from- the extreme poverty, overcrowding etc. Here, in the early stages of the favela, we meet our main characters, along with the supporting cast. The story revolves mainly around two characters living in the favela, Rocket and Lil Ze, and how they take two different paths through life. Rocket's dream is to become a photographer and to escape the City of God while Lil Ze becomes a powerful gang leader and drug dealer."
Young man growing up in 1970s Brazil dodging a crime lord.,code_red1984,16 July 2005,10,"This was a great film and will always be one of my favs... The realism is phenomenal and the characters stand out in so many different ways. Lil' Ze is without a doubt the meanest guy ever, and Knockout Ned is one of my favorite heroes. The only complaint I have is Rocket, he just seems kind of boring in some areas. I think that there is a true representation of the gang disputes and the fact that after a year of fighting no one even remembers why they are fighting for. That speaks a lot for the wars in our very own past. Without a doubt one of the strongest films that I have seen in a long time. Not for the casual movie-goer being that the entire film is in Portuguese."
"If ""GoodFellas"" were set in Rio de Janeiro",ddude1116,24 April 2012,10,"Films either rely more on style and less on substance, or more on substance and less on style. Here is a film which finds the perfect balance. Set in the slums of Rio de Janeiro, it takes the dreary atmosphere of desperation and poverty and breathes new life into it, giving it a pulse of color and rapid camera movement. This film follows the life of Rocket, a kid born to be into crime merely to survive, and how he becomes what he wanted to be. He is the narrator, and it opens with him being caught in what appears to be a scuffle between a local gang, and the cops. But he quickly interjects, telling us as the audience how we won't understand unless we know the entire story, and so it begins with one of the most minor and clever tricks of the camera. These little bits exist so completely in this film, you hardly notice them, they work so effectively. They work to bring you into the slum, and between the narrator and the director, you'll feel as though you've lived in a slum all of your life, and are merely used to the goings-on. This film is truly a spectacle to behold, and one of the best films I've ever seen."
Extremely hard to watch emotionally.,tidsoptimist,14 November 2018,7,"This movie was gut-wrenching. I had to turn it off when one of the older thugs asked the two little boys whether they wanted to be shot in the foot or hand as ""punishment."" He shot both little kids (one in the hand and the other in the foot) and the youngest (who was probably 6 or 7) started screaming and crying for his mommy. I myself am I mom of two and I couldn't imagine a young child going through this. I've watched movies like Snowtown Murders with no problem but when young kids are involved I just can't handle it."
Great movie,jahouston-96994,22 September 2016,9,"I really enjoyed this movie. The acting was really good and I learned a lot about the culture. The main character narrates the whole thing, and he eventually causes a gang war. I really liked how the movie showed the slums. The depiction of the slums showed how much violence was there. The corruption became clear as day. The gangs ran the city. In The City of God Lil Ze becomes one of the most feared gang leaders. Eventually, he climbs to the top with his friend and they rule the slums together. He pays off basically all of the cops for them to let him do his thing. They make so much money it is ridiculous. However, his friend gets shot which shocked me. It was actually the narrator who was just trying to avenge his brothers death. Lil Ze had killed his brother earlier in the movie. It is hard to imagine that people actually live in slums run by people like Lil Ze. I really wonder what it is like to be an average person in that society."
The City of God was GREAT,tadegeare,22 September 2016,10,The City of God was definitely the best international movie that I have ever seen. I really enjoyed the filming styles that were used because it made the film that much more interesting than the plot and plot twists themselves. The background stories of each character and the fact that the movie started with the end just like a lot of American films made it really interesting and suspenseful at a lot of parts. It is really easy to get used to the fact that the entire film is in subtitles and that doesn't effect the quality of the film at all. It is easy to understand it while also following what is happening. I really liked the characters in the film and the interactions that they had with each other as well as the clear personality traits that they had. I really wish that Benny wasn't killed but overall I really enjoyed this movie and even the way it ended.
"City of God is a clinic of competent, bold film-making satisfaction.",hillalbens,11 July 2019,10,"From beginning to end, City of God is beautiful, pointed, enthusiastic, and adventurous in every category. The cinematography and editing deserve enormous heaps of praise. The writing, acting, and directing come together for a visceral, haunting experience."
Stunning,mk-69503,12 July 2022,8,"The movie was good and some soundtrack is good..... It engages me from start to end..... Superbly potrait the two guys, one wants to good photographer and another one wants to be a bad gangster... Benny character attracts me a lot and taught some lessons."
A masterpiece for the ages,acrighto-24997,4 February 2016,10,"Set in the slums of 1960s and 70s Rio De Janeiro, this masterpiece somehow manages to be both a romantic coming-of-age tale, a brutal drama, and an action-packed gangster movie all in one."
Understanding Urban Violence in Brazil,Xyko,12 September 2002,9,It's common knowledge throughout the world that Brazil has a very serious problem of violence. The most outstanding example are the slums in Rio de Janeiro.

Brilliant but nihilist; where is its heart?,davesf,15 March 2007,7,So you thought Hamlet or Tosca were violent?
One of the BEST I've ever seen (any genre),krnkd5,20 April 2003,10,"Wow! The best gangster movie (i even liked it better than Godfather saga). Incredible writing makes it sooooo realistic, incredible acting, incredible camerawork, just incredible! What puts this movie on an even higher level is that it is based on a true story. WOW!"
City of God (2002),nadamelsayed,17 October 2016,6,"Meirelles' City of God (2002) is a heart-wrenching, stomach-churning adaption of a drug war and organized crime in Rio De Janeiro in 1960-1980. Based on real events and people, we follow the growth of children and their journey to become men in a city filled with violence and drug abuse. We watch their fight to stay alive and some's rise to power, and ultimately for others, their demise. We learn in the film that regardless of what path you choose in life in the City of God, you're not safe. Your life is on the line even for being at the wrong place at the wrong time."
Oh my god! Try to understand Brazil to understand the movie,garotinho,31 December 2003,10,I´ve seen an comment by howard.schumann about City of God... I was surprised! Because he said a lot of untruth information about Brazil.
Must be on the top 10!!! Excellent Movie. Perfect...,garotinho,12 June 2003,10,"Cidade de Deus is truly one of the great movies of cinema history... Dramatic, funny, sad, revolting. The movie makes you think about everything that happens around the world but you don´t hear about. I know brazil, and I say that I couldnt imagine that it´s true, it happens every day. It´s a movie about world´s reality"
Brazilian masterpiece !,jpblondeau,19 March 2006,10,"Meirelles pumps out an absolutely amazing film - you definitely climb aboard for the roller-coaster ride through the slums of Rio ! And it is a lot more original than his lastest ""americanized"" flick (the Gardner dude)."
Good movie,bruskismail,8 May 2018,8,You get to see a whole different Brazil. Actors are good and story line is perfect.
An unflinching and rich film,ink2quill,21 November 2018,9,This film deserves all the positive reviews it got and I understand why it is a cult classic. I loved the way the characters navigated their dangerous world and the dynamics between them. You can´t help but sympathise with the beautiful people of this story and root for them. This is such a good film that gets better with time.
"The opening of this movie is classic, and then it gets better.",jesse3,3 December 2003,10,"There has never been a film like this. I have worked on over a hundred productions as an actor/writer/director/producer, and  I don't have a clue as to how they captured a world that dwells beyond Dante's inferno. What a ride! Congratulations to these brilliant, dedicated soldiers of filmmaking. This film deserved multiple oscars. May their (the writers/director/producer/actors) cinematic spirit live forever. Holy cow."
city of god,e-61451,31 March 2020,9,"Then ferocious growth and then confused reflection is not a police and bandits collude to save after the end of the street. Everything is reincarnation, or as a photographer in the chaos of the legitimate occupation good ah."
Suprise after suprise after suprise!!!,noize23,1 March 2003,10,Suprise after suprise after suprise.
My personal favorite film of all-time,LatinoNoir,21 December 2003,10,"Having watched this in the theatres, I can say that this is the best movie-going experience I've ever had. This is a masterpiece of filmmaking. The recreation of this true story and true to life depiction of life in Brazilian favelas is brilliant. The film is also visually stunning, with great use of color and camera work. Some of the very few detractors claim the cinematography and soundtrack glamorize the tragic events that transpire in the story...but they don't truly understand the filmmakers' message. The highly stylized cinematography and hip soundtrack only reflects the attitudes of the young men who live in these places. This is the best way these young men can look at the world around them. It's a fast and furious lifestyle and that's what the cinematography and soundtrack aspire to help recreate. There's absolutely no sign of glamorizing the violence in this film, however. This film gets my highest recommendation and I urge people to check it out. The region 1 DVD comes out Feb. 17, 2004 and will include a 45 minute documentary of the true story on which the movie is based. I hope it's not too late for the film to at least get Best Foreign Film recognition at the Oscars. If it were up to me, it would win BEST PICTURE, but that's not likely to happen. Lord of the Rings' ROTK isn't anything to sneeze at, unlike last years Chicago, though."
`Once Upon A Time In America' for the year 2000,Rinaear,4 March 2004,,"When violence is a language and survival a word written in blood, when children kill and get killed by the sound of laughter, life runs faster than a chicken running away from the knife. There, in the City Of God. `Cidade De Deus' (City Of God) is the name of a multi-family social housing project constructed in the sixties, that became a huge slum quarter (`favela') in the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro and a center for drug traffic in Brasil. The film, by the same name, makes the raw and fascinating portrait of the transformation of the kids from the block into mega drug dealers of the seventies and early eighties. From the eyes of Buscapé (Alexandro Rodrigues), a poor, sensitive black kid growing in that universe of violence, we see the gathering of the pieces of rubble that make a great real story. Buscapé has the dream of becoming a photographer, and his lack of courage to enter in a life of crime will ultimately place him in the center of one of the biggest gang wars ever to occur in the city of Rio. In the space between the lines lies a beautiful story that is a truthful register of the growth of urban inhumanity. The city that grows and surrounds the quarter that has no light, no schools and no sanitation, forgotten by the government. It's that people with no hope or jobs that slowly penetrates into crime, from small robberies into achieving the full majority: drugs. And weapons. The film dissects the structure of violence, the traffic and the corruption from whence it feeds from. But beyond that, the story shown is much more than a superficial aesthetic display of crime. The story is transmitted in the small details, in gestures of guilt, corruption, friendship. The realism of the language and images is complete, without ideological sermons. This is `Once Upon A Time In America' for the year 2000. This is a great film."
I recommend watching City of God,vikesh2295,16 October 2016,9,"I think that the City of God was a great film to watch. The story line was good and very interesting because there were a few things in the plot where you don't know what was going to happen. Not to be very specific but some parts of the film were mysterious. There were a couple of different slow motion scenes in this film which also gives mystery and makes you wonder what's going to happen to this person that's being filmed in slow-motion. The film puts into perspective of how gang-related wars are around the world and how dangerous it is to be in the city that these gangs have taken over. The majority of the movie was filmed during daylight and in my opinion that is good because you as a viewer are able to see more things in daylight than the dark of course. The acting was done very well and it all seemed so real rather than formal. A lot of the camera shots were either close-up or medium shots which is good in my opinion because it helps the audience get a little more personal with the characters and really see the sadness and greediness of some of these characters. Even though the film is not in English it sets the movie's plot and story much better because, as i mentioned before, it gives a better perspective of life outside of the U.S. which can be really interesting as it was in this film. There was a lot of betrayal and drug dealing as well as killings of enemy gangs over territory, money, and guns. I would've liked to see more wealth in this film because wealth shows power especially when it is gang related. I recommend that you watch this movie. Overall I think this movie was great and I would watch it again."
A movie that was born classic,fgfotocinema,16 February 2018,10,"I saw Cidade de Deus in a movie theater, just the week of the premiere. Although there were long queues, and there was almost no place to sit in the room (I only got a seat in the front row where no one usually sits), I was not prepared for the impact the play produced on me. In a clear language, and with direct images, but without being appealing, the film showed how the period when the favelas were idealized by the middle class occurred - after all, because they were in the hills, it was said that they lived there from the sky '- to communities where gun-to-mouth drug-trafficking shootings are a constant. Combining bluntness and good humor, Cidade de Deus is a movie that was born classic, and that only improves every time you review it."
"Visually stunning, emotionally moving",michaelchowdhury,5 January 2006,9,"A breathless mixture of vivid images, well-scripted dialogue in the now-famous 'Tarantino' mould and a storyline that is based on true events."
It's a great realistic film that tells the truth.,ultimoteimoso,5 April 2006,9,"I'm an American living in Brazil for 5yrs now. I watched the movie on TV the other night and was very impressed with it. The quality was very good and gives you the feeling of actually being there and viewing it first hand. The movie depicts life as it was and still is. The people here are generally extremely poor and desperate. The corruption within this country can be found in ever level of Government and under the table payoffs are a way of life for many. Life is cheap and large numbers of people across the country die a violent death every day. Drugs are prevalent and a big money maker for the drug lords. Every kind of drug can be found being sold on the streets. The poorest of the drug users use a cheap drug by-product which make them easy to identify as their front teeth are missing or black and rotting away. Others walk around sniffing glue. Certain areas of Rio de Janeiro are controlled by the drug lords and their followers just like it's depicted in the movie. They have a small army of very young children working as runners taking orders and delivering the drugs to the waiting customer. In those areas it's not uncommon to see even the children walking openly brandishing a firearm. Even the military and police hesitate to enter these areas as it closely resembles a war zone. What you will see in the movie, believe it, because it is NOT an exaggerated fictional movie. These things are happening in cities all across Brazil every day. On the flip side the majority of people here are very kind generous loving families. They are very religious are honest hard working people. The students work extremely hard to get good grades so they will be able to win a full scholarship to attend the best universities in the nation. Just because someone lives and grows up in a favela (slum) it doesn't mean they condone the lawlessness. Some do become great leaders in every walk of life. I can honestly say I know some of them and am very proud to be able to call them my friends. Watch the movie and I can guarantee you'll be stunned and left thinking about it for day with a sad heart that this exists in our world."
Showing the Dystopic Undderworld of Normal People in Poverty,leginrenroc,29 March 2018,9,"Great Picture. I believe the true lure of this movie is that, it shows the dystopic underworld that can come to pass when seemingly normal people has no espace from poverty. The decisions that come after, consciously made by these normal people can be very obtuse and because it shows us ourselves in this kind of light and getting you lured into the picture, it does it's job of truly telling a epic story. Doesn't get enough credit."
One of the best movies ever 🎥,jnsftsdj,10 February 2020,10,"You just have to see it by yourself, just incredible 👏🏼."
Great,RealisGod,16 February 2019,,Great film! I was very intrigued by the storyline! I am blessed to have seen this! A must see. God is good.
One of the must-see crime movies,brad861222,8 October 2018,8,"It's always important for good movies to keep some mysteries, so that I enjoyed the time guessing why the issues happened through watching the movies.
Besides, villains got what they deserved after they committed crimes, and victims got the chance to revenge are the most exciting plots for sure."
Intense,cintiaz-1,4 May 2003,,"This is one of the most intense, attention grabbing movie I've ever seen. The way it was filmed, the acting, everything about it will keep you glued to the screen. Anyone that loves Pulp Fiction will love this movie. You will also learn things about the most beautiful city in the world, that few people ever see."
WOW!,sean.littletribefilms,24 January 2003,,"One of the best films i have ever seen and one of the best films ever made...no doubt about it, a classic already, up there with ShawShank Goodfellas, and Stand By Me. This is Film making/acting/writing at its very best...bravo!!!!!!"
One of the best,ryanlouislinehan,9 September 2018,10,One of the best films of all time. A must watch from Brasil!
No man's land,dick-roger,23 February 2009,10,"I watched this movie again yesterday night and now I am quite sure that it was an injustice this movie do not have been awarded with at least one Oscar.. and this Oscar, for sure, should be for Editing. It is remarkable! I would like to congratulate in special Daniel Rezende for the great and professional work he realized! There is not very much to add to the other reviews about this movie, that is a must see for everyone who likes cinema above any kind of plot and/or genre. And if you like the history, and it is wondering if those kids can be be controlled, do not miss ""Tropa De Elite"" and see the other side of the life in Rio's slums on another same level movie"
Splendid Cinematic Experience,ashwinrosswel,30 September 2010,9,This movie has one of the best opening sequences... Reminds me of Arvind Adiga's 'Rooster Coup' in the novel 'The White Tiger'.
Excellent,mhulbert,9 February 2004,,"Sometimes popular culture quotes work as well as Shakespeare. I'm Not Down, by The Clash, has the following lines:"
Masterpiece,jonas-adolfsson,11 August 2003,10,I recommend you to read the comments by Shiva-11 for a full review.
Great!,ogunorta,18 December 2018,10,This is one of the most beatiful movie ever. Every part of the movie has a excitement. The story of the movie is connected with each part of the movie. You can't be bored while you watch the movie.
Subtitles,knotwilg,17 October 2003,9,"Just a word about the Dutch subtitles, well you couldn't care less I guess. As I am fairly fluent in Portuguese, I could tell that the Dutch subtitles were translated from English rather than straight from Portuguese. Quite a few things get lost in the double translation. Everybody knows the game where a sentence is whispered from ear to ear to arrive back to its originator completely mutilated. So here's a plea for more originality (in both senses) in the subtitles. BTW, it's awkward to read some comments here about ""first watch of a subtitled movie"". We get that all the time."
"brilliant, energized, hyper-real, crushing! talk about your tough childhoods.",z88zepo,21 February 2003,10,"wow!  this film really blew me away.  every single performance was right on the money, everything felt so real it was like watching a documentary, but oozing with style.  this is one of the most powerful films i have seen in a long time and provided an uncompromising look into the brutal everyday world of the kids in the slums of rio.  heartbreaking!"
Too much violence and blood,zapiekanki,30 January 2004,,"I keep mixed feelings about this movie. Generally, I would say it's just too violent for my taste. All you get to see is guns, drug trade, corruption... Not that this isn't a feature of Brazilian favelas, but I mean, there's much more pretty things to be portrayed in a movie, like the kindness and friendly spirit of the people down there."
True story,Rusty_Boy,15 February 2004,,I live in Brazil.
Tough to Watch But Well Worth It,clintswift,19 July 2004,10,"Several times now I have gotten into discussions with people regarding this film.  The most common criticism that I hear is ""how could you watch children killing children.""  I have to say that it is a fair criticism of the subject matter of the film but not of the film it self.  This film is based on actual events that took place in the seventies in the slums of Rio. The film is brilliant at catching the desperation of some of the poorest people in the world.  For many people in the US this kind of poverty coupled with violence is unimaginable and the shock can be quite powerfull.  I applaud the filmmakers for artfully completing such a difficult task.  The cinematography is magnificent.  Alexandre Rodrigues beautifully does his part at portraying the difficulties that all teenagers face growing up (sex, carrer, frienship etc...) but with the extra challenge of having to deal with growing up with one of the most dangerous neiborhoods in the world. Over all a very good film."
Sums it up,Rodan11,12 October 2004,,"If you live through the TOP 250 List of the IMDb best films ever, there are certain milestones of movie-history which come along uncompared to whatever came thereafter. Godfather's epic design, Shawshank Redemptions brilliant story-developing, Pulp Fictions step into the next millennium of fulfillment for the movie needs of a new generation. Breathtaking adoption of fairy tales like LOTR 1-3, melting Kids and Adults together in Toy Story 1 &2 leaves one back in the seat forever. What should be next? Any new movie design possible to fit in the TOP 250 IMDb List. Impossible I shouted out loud and slept well in my movie chair, until I have seen CITY OF GODS. With no expectations at all, I didn't breathe for the entire movie, no time for POPCORN and the drink. The opening scene sums up MTV Type of Clip-Movies in 3 Minutes and leaves u wishing to read the book, so that you can check for the ending, because you are thrilled into the last peace of your body. But the movie keeps its tension till the end. Cinematography at its best, with really unseen techniques not being incorporated for the selfsuck of the cinematographer, purely for the needs of the storytelling. Not a single actor appeared in TV Sitcom before, not on stage or in the movies before and all are playing there lives better than anybody could do. I could continue to describe why I think, that this movie is expanding the TOP 250 List not only because of the voters, it is really one step ahead in movie development and the best of it: It is not out of the Hollywood-Sundance-Cannes Bowl."
Awsome movie,rjps-12,26 July 2020,8,"Just love it, u need to watch it

"A Lens Into the Slums of Rio, Not Into the Individual Lives",tarekshabana,2 July 2017,10,"This film can be fully appreciated only on second viewing (if not more). What I found to be most fascinating in city of god, and is easily felt on first viewing, was that even though the film is full of ""flashbacks"" it captivates you in a way that makes you feel the timeline is linearly moving forward. For instance, whenever a new character or a new place is shown, we're waiting for that ""the story of..."" and we're so interested that we forget about the current events taking place and indulge in the brilliant storytelling. We know this is a flashback, but we're in no hurry for it to finish so we can get back to the storyline."
Cidade de Deus,hazimmer,25 September 2016,7,"City of God struck a chord with me negatively for a few different reasons. My first reason is that the cinematography was shot in a way that, although brilliant, definitely gave me a headache. The beginning and end scene with the chicken are notable examples of this. It was really hard to focus on what was happening because of the sudden jump cuts, and this coupled with the loud, fast-paced music in the scenes were pretty off-putting. The other reason is that the violence in the movie was a bit much, but considering the fact that its plot literally revolved around gangs, I can't really complain. That being said, I really enjoyed this movie. I thought that the way the story was told from multiple angles was incredibly well-executed, and it was really fascinating to see the same scenes be shot and perceived in an entirely different angle than they had appeared just moments before. I have to give the team behind this movie credit where it is due, as I can't recall ever seeing any American movies that were filmed in this manner. The way that the two main characters Li'l Zé and Rocket are linked is quite interesting as well. Rocket is the younger brother of Goose, a gang member that Li'l Zé killed. Despite this, Rocket uses his photography skills as a source of income and to unknowingly promote Li'l Zé and his gang, who make their income off drug money. The method in which these two different stories are linked is really well coordinated, and give the movie more substance."
Great Movie,brszasz,22 September 2016,10,"I think this film is the best international film I have ever seen. The way they tell the story of each individual story separately while making it all come together is truly brilliant. It is very easy to get mixed up into the fascinating stories of these characters. I like dissecting the lives of gangs to see what that kind of life is like for a normal gang member. This movie went in depth about the lives of many gang members from a few different gangs. I also liked Rocket's perspective on the situation, because he is different from most who live in the City of God. Rocket is a smart young man who can get out of the crazy city and be successful with a good education. While most are forced into the gang life at a young age, Rocket stays true to his path of becoming a photographer without being involved with the dirty work of gangs. It was interesting to me how Lil Ze died. He ended up being shot by a bunch of kids who did not know any better, but this made me wonder that he could have been shot at any point during the movie. It begs me to ask the question of why wasn't he killed at any point during the movie when he was killing people himself all the time."
"Finally, a good Latin American movie",ThiagoBertho,29 August 2004,9,This is undoubtedly the best Brazilian movie ever. I give it 9 out of 10. It is totally different of previous Brazilian movies and worths to be seen even by those who have hated all Brazilian movies that have watched.
amazing,obi_skillz,27 March 2003,10,"Going into this film all I knew was that it was supposed to be good.  What I did not know was that I was going to see one of the very best films of 2002. My poor words cannot give this movie justice.  It is filmmaking at it's peak.  Sure it will make some squem, probably why the film recieved zero Acadamy Award nominations, but along with Y Tu Mama Tambien, City of God help proves that south american film is alive and strong.  A great film worthy of a grand audience."
"A very good film, if a little stylised.",sartois99,17 January 2003,8,"City of God is a film set, appropriately enough, in the slums called the 'City of God'. It revolves around a variety of characters but centrally around Rocket - a young black guy who wants to become a photographer whilst also staying out of the various gangs in the neighbourhood. Also central are Little Ze and Bene, with various other gang lords appearing. The film follows a timeline from Rocket's childhood to the present day."
True Grit Inner City Docudrama,brianbohmueller,21 June 2022,8,"City of God feels authentic in its harrowing portrayal of life in the slums of Rio. When society fails to support its citizens at all levels, culture too easily devolves to a Lord of the Flies mentality."
"A visceral, dark, but tremendously compelling film",forbes-anderson-96,22 August 2013,10,This film is truly incredible. It's basically a picture of the lives of a group of boys as they move from pre-teens to young adults and it's startling yet simultaneously exciting to watch.
Not recommended for those with weak constitution,marcoses,26 December 2002,8,"Having lived in Rio de Janeiro during the 70's I recall all the violence involved with Cidade de Deus. During that period, that region became the synonym of violence. It was quite intriguing to see how fiction had treated the dreadful reality."
Life on the wrong side of the tracks,camsean73,21 March 2003,10,"This movie is amazing in the way that it shows how corruption in government and the police effect the lives of ordinary people. Anyone of us in comfortable 1st world countries should be thankfull that we are not living under a goverment that is foolish enough to create a ""City of God"". Amazing well acted, filmed and written."
One of the best movies,grvaltas,26 December 2014,10,"This is an amazing movie.After you watch it it lets you think a lot about things that never came across your mind.Basically this movie describes a city that you THOUGHT it was very rare and you wouldn't expect it to exist.However many poor cities are like this one .This city has poverty and most children have guns , and teenagers that rob shops and trade or use drugs while police cannot do anything.It shows two kind of people , one who wants to be a photographer and wants to leave this city and have a career while the other one wants to be the biggest drug dealer in that city and obviously wants to stay and not leave the city.Except from this awesome plot and story ( that is true) this movie is filmed and in an excellent way where the scenes fit perfectly and you enjoy watching every second of it. I gave it a 10 because it deserves it and because it is a unique movie which shows people in poverty which try to earn money to live."
Good. Though Sin Nombre is better,juanmirocks,21 February 2018,7,"It's a good movie. But the often happy-sounding music makes it all look much lighter and without consequence. The recent movie Sin Nombre is more cruel, which I think it's the point of such a movie type."
A bittersweet must-see,scotchtape,2 January 2003,9,"The synopsis of City of God was compelling enough to begin with, but when the subject matter is coupled with the dazzling, lush visuals that Meirelles and Lund have achieved, the result is a true cinematic treat."
An Extraordinary Film,TDavis12,11 February 2003,10,"I saw City of God last night and it easily ranks as one of my top ten films of all time. This film about drug-dealing and gang wars in the slums surrounding Rio de Janeiro is a great example of synergy; everything gelled in this film: the story, plot, characters, acting, cinematography, score, and the overall production values. This film is unpleasant and brutal on the senses at times (it isn't for children) but I give it the highest recommendation to those who can handle it."
Truly Brutal,user-169-219219,1 June 2013,8,"I have never seen crime glorified in this way. Frankly, a little psychopath in me giggled at the end. Godfather and Goodfellas were great but they seemed to be more white collar when compared to our IT lives. City Of God (Cidade de Deus) is what crime is, means and should end like. Crude, naked and gory. Set in Cidade de Deus in Rio de Janeiro and based on novel by the same name, movie showcases the underbelly of crime in its crudest avatar."
A psychological thriller that expands traditional thinking of growing up,leslienorthcutt,30 September 2015,9,"City of God is one of the first movies I ever watched, or at least remembered watching. This foreign film (to America) depicts what its like growing up in poverty, near Rio De Janeiro, and what it takes to survive these conditions. The lead character explains what it was like being in the trio of ""bad"" kids from his neighborhood, running from the cops, and stories of his friends at a young age committing mass murder. Our main character finds solace in photography in opposition to gang-banging, which seems to be the norm the rest of the children fall naturally into. The story pans out to illustrate that no one leaves the gang or Rio De Janeiro for that matter, unless they're in a body bag. A structural system of family and friendship does not trump money or greed and is a beautiful picture of how these deadly sins abolish your life."
Grim Look At Reality,hippy109,11 December 2004,,This film was more like a documentary about Rio. I do not understand how IMDb has given it a 8.7 out of 10. A subtitled film does not warrant this film a score as high as 8.7. To be more than fair I would give it a 5 for effort. A movie having subtitles seems to turn on viewers and make them give more credit than is rightfully due.
A wide open window into Favelas,EdwardSaberhagen,7 July 2014,10,Meirelles didn't hesitated in showing us how tough life can be.
Simply Brilliant!,wamweri,11 August 2004,10,"Purely Amazing This is without a doubt the best film i have seen all year. It shows the true the story of a group of young kids growing up in the slums in Rio. It has a little mix of Stand by Me, Lord of the Flies and Pulp Fiction all rolled into one. This film is completely breath-taking from start to its gruesome finish."
An overwhelming view of life in a favela,kennedystones,30 September 2016,10,"To start, I know most of you don't know Portuguese and don't understand some cultural details that would really make this movie's watching experience a sensational one. But just imagine if you did."
A real life story of terror and heart,Rancor-3,17 September 2004,10,"Let me begin with a minor rant: The front of the DVD case depicts a guy and a girl sitting on a beach, one kissing the other, and a group of hoodlums standing around, some holding guns, though that really isn't the clearest picture you see. The colors are warm. The tagline is ""15 miles away from paradise... one man will do anything to tell the world everything."""
War on drugs depicted in Masterpiece!,libbyr-60878,13 October 2016,10,"City of God is a masterpiece, taking a true story of the war on drugs in the slums of Brazil, combining it with local actors, a couple shoot-outs, and an outstanding soundtrack, this film stands up as one of the most influential foreign films of the 21st century. It's quite difficult to create a foreign film directed so brilliantly that the audience forgets they are reading subtitles from beginning to end.     The use of tilted shots creates the chaotic environment the characters are living in, for the audiences in the theaters, and also creates a sense of distortion, as if the character's portrayed are unstable, specifically when Lil' Ze is in frame. This allows them to feel as if there are with these kids: running away, selling drugs, taking a bullet, or smoking pot. The extensive use of color and quick cuts instead of fading from shot to shot, allows the audience to see an intensity in the film, vibration from story-to-story and character-to-character. The similar clothing colors of those in the slums, compared to the drastically different ones of the bigger city, show the relationship the slum characters have in common with each other, even though they are not the same people, they come from the same place. The one character who changes the most is Benny, who also most drastically changes his clothes the most drastically, coincidence? I think not!  The soundtrack is not one you'd listen to in your car, but the specific use of silence and sounds are noticeable. The explosions of guns during the shoot-outs from one end of the city to another is portrayed beautifully with the on-going action in the scene. The dramatic music played at the club Benny gets shot at is played to create suspense, as well as the strobe light continuously blinking, until we hear the gun go off.  The character's are so well-developed that anyone watching this film for the first time could easily give a summary of each named character, as well as identify with one."
The dark side of the magnificent Brazilian soul,micmic1431968,11 March 2003,,"I've always been a lover of Brazil and have been fascinated by Brazilian music & culture for years, although I've never been there (yet). This movie is deeply Brazilian, and -strange as it may seem- it made me love Brazil even more. From the first to the last minute, you really can't take your eyes of the screen. It's a shocking movie, true, but it is also refreshing and unique. The directors have simply done the best work I've EVER seen! It's that simple. The actors are unbelievable when you think that most of them have never acted before. But the true power of the movie is the diffusive, captivating, romantic -and at the same time cruel- Brazilian soul. This is the kind of movie that after the first couple of minutes makes any noisy spectators shut up and watch with open mouths till the end titles and beyond. Those who have watched the legendary ""Orfeu Negro"" can't help but compare the happy, shiny faces of the children in ""Orfeu Negro"" with the scared and frightening faces of the children in this movie. The beautiful and the ugly face of the favela... I really can't say much more except that this movie is not entertainment but experience..."
City of God,mauricioherrera-12791,15 October 2016,10,"City of God is, in my opinion, a complete masterpiece. Director Fernando Meirelles' use of a predominantly amateur cast (with some actors, including Leandro Firmino, the actor who played the role of adult Lil Ze, formerly living in the real-life City of God) allows the film to have a very real, candid showing of life within a dangerous slum. In a world where the most promising way of life is to rob, steal, and deal drugs, our main character Rocket (Alexandre Rodrigues) must try to remain honest and steer clear of the life of crime ahead of him. The film is a fast-paced brutal thriller that unapologetically depicts the real struggles of a life of poverty in one of Rio de Jainero's most dangerous slums. One of the film's greatest achievements is the complete submersion of the audience in the unforgiving world of the City of God, in order to establish a feeling of isolation and desperation, where danger lurks around every corner only to be completely contrasted with shots depicting the more stable metropolitan areas of Rio. This submersion is accomplished using many techniques. First, depicting the origin of the slum in the 1960's as more bright and containing only few criminals only to slowly descend into more violence and criminals, and more killing for the sake of killing in the 1980's. The intensity of the slum is shown with darker lighting, a funky soundtrack, faster cuts, and more firefights. For me, the reason this film succeeds so well is due to the fact that instead of the audience viewing the favela from a safe distance and experiencing feelings of horror because of how different it is from our comfortable lives, we are forced to live it as the real inhabitants do, to be completely submerged in the city with seemingly no way out, and that is terrifying in a completely different way."
The City of God is the slums of Rio De Janeiro that shapes two very different boys as they grow into men on a collision course for disaster.,jenniferemeyer,15 October 2016,9,"The Directors, Fernando Meirelles and Kátia Lund, did an astonishing job of engulfing the audience into the movie. The use of tilted shots helps make the audience feel like they are a part of the gang trying to survive living in the City of God. The shots and editing also give it a very realistic and hectic feeling, which adds to feeling of being in the film. Like during the party, right before the killer attacks, the use of strobe lights and quickly cutting between people gives this intense feeling in the audience's stomach something bad is about to happen."
Wonderful - but not violent enough!,stevesw9,8 January 2003,,"tmwest from S.Paulo stated ""this film is so violent, it makes Tarantino look like Walt Disney"". I just cannot agree. RESERVOIR DOGS (especially of Tatantino's films) was seen as ultra-violent. I believe that this is because 'hard-men' screamed in agony when they were hurt. This made a dramatic emotional impact. The violence in CITY OF GOD is seen by some as ""banal"". Yes! My concern is that the violence didn't hurt enough. Only the scene where the Runts were punished really depicted the true pain (IMHO)."
City of God,emilybatara,17 October 2016,9,"Fernando Meirelles' City of God (2002), is a remarkable representation of the slums in Rio de Janeiro during the 1960s through the 1970s. This film walks you through the life of Rocket, an aspiring photographer, who lives in the City of God and faces danger every day of his life. Throughout this film, Rocket tells the stories of the many different people who lived in the City of God and their journey which lead to their ultimate death or survival. This film captures the violence occurring not only through the presentation of deaths caught on camera, but by the fearful screaming, crying, and begging of lives. Where hearing the loud and painful sounds of guns being fired off and seeing bloody, mutilated bodies lying on the street is just another ordinary day. The setting of this film and the mise-en-scene allows the viewer to understand the struggles that the townsman live through, the rundown town, and the fight to stay alive. This film starts with the ending by utilizing a freeze frame then flashes back to how it all began leading up to the current situation."
Eye Opener,melanie-82379,17 October 2016,10,**Spoilers Ahead**
one the best foreign films I've ever seen,guster-1,29 April 2006,9,"This is one of my favourite films of all time. The reason being is that as soon as I finished watching the film, I was compelled to watch it again straight after(the only film to have made me do this was The Usual suspects). It's very fast paced and it really sucks you in to the characters and their situations. The film gives the viewer a real insight in to what happens in this city and how life really is for it's inhabitants."
An amazing story telling experience,tlc-82217,17 October 2016,9,"The City of God is an amazing film that portrays the lives of those living in Brazilian slums. The film focuses on a boy nicknamed Rocket and his struggle of trying to live an honest life in a dishonest world. City of God is told as a culmination of stories that focuses on different characters throughout the film. Multiple times it introduces a character as someone who isn't the main focus of the story, but later plays a big part in a different story. This style of storytelling made the characters interesting because the viewer has already met the character and is excited to hear their story in depth. City of God also has really solid framing with the story ending in the same place it started. The use of flashbacks also help tell the story concisely and reminds the viewer of important details that might have been forgotten. The camera work in the film is a thing of beauty. An abundant use of hand-held shots makes it seem like you're actually there. The opening tracking shot was particularly impressive as it followed a wild chicken through the streets. Whenever a new place is introduced, there is a nice exposition shot so the viewer has a good understanding of where the scene is taking place because a lot of the slums can look very similar. The acting in the film is pretty good considering many of the minor characters were local children in the area with no acting experience."
City Of God.... is the real deal!!!,bbro3886,16 May 2006,10,"It is not a habit of mine to give movies a perfect score... but this one is just what movie magic is all about. Everything about this movie is perfect.... it just genius... The movie tells the story of a boy living in the slums of Rio DE Janeiro, Brazil AKA CIty Of God..... there life is tough and violent... even more for good people like the boy in this story... the only thing he longs for is to be a photographer and get out of the bloody neighborhood he is in where gunshots and violence are a daily happening. When two rival gangs start a full out war.. the boy decides to leave but it just might be too late for him........ This movie is a must see for any movie buff, although be aware it contains very violent scenes thus it is not for all kinds of people that said.. it is a great movie..... what adds to it is the fact that it is supposedly based in real events.... I do not doubt it as I have heard about the violence over there in South America is out of hand...... the DVD contains a documentary about Rio De Janeiro's gangs which will give you an insight into the sad reality they are living under over there. I give City Of God 10 out of 10"
Review for City of God,lpeterselli,17 October 2016,10,The Following Review may contain spoilers for City of God
"Has everything- philosophical depth, suspense, film-craft. It's a 10.",lisuebie,2 February 2007,10,"A whole lot of people die in this film, and they are not the weightless, clean, entertainment deaths of your average adventure, action or crime flick."
Favela... A Vicious Cycle,tjstingl,17 October 2016,10,"Tom Stingl *SPOILER ALERT* Directors Fernando Meirelles and Katia Lund released the movie City of God in 2002 and is now known as one of the greatest foreign films ever made. Especially one coming out of Brazil. The film depicts the life of an average boy growing up in a fa vela and the birth of a tyrannical drug lord. This film utilizes the best out of the thriller, action, and drama genres of film, often times leaving the viewer on the edge of their seat for the majority of the movie and becoming truly emotionally attached to many of the characters."
Goodfellas of the Barrio,morrow_n,17 October 2016,9,"City of God (2002) ﻿﻿ is a film ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿directed by Fernando Meirelles and Katia Lund. Main actors include Alexandre Rodrigues (Rocket), Leandro Firmino ﻿﻿﻿(Ze), and Philipe Haagensen (Benny)."
City of god,aimeereich-79524,7 December 2016,9,"City of God is a great movie for countless different reasons. One thing this movie does very well is create an authentic, gritty feeling around it. It's been said that the director cast multiple untrained actors from various slums around brazil due to lack of professional Brazilian actors, and to create the same grittiness I previously mentioned. More than half of the movie consists of Gun fights between Knockout Neds gang and Lil Ze's gang. The story line is told very well, as it starts when rocket, who narrates the movie, is just a little kid, but not yet a big part of the movie. The movie really gets deeper into the story when Lil Ze, who at the time was called Lil Dice, kills rockets brother. The movie peaks however when fellow hood Blacky kills Benny, Lil Ze's best friend and partner in crime at his farewell party, as he decided to leave with his girlfriend. The acting in the movie is really good even though these actors aren't professional, and the story was well written. This is a really solid movie that i enjoyed a lot."
A genuine masterpiece! ... A must see!,johnsmith2022,13 December 2005,10,"Never yet had I seen such a movie with all of the elements that I want in a movie, until I had seen this one. Who would've thought that it would come in a foreign film, or in a true story? ""City of God"" ( ""Cidade de Deus"" ) is the story of a teenage boy living in one of Rio de Janeiro's slums, and he dreams of becoming a photographer. The boy's name is Rocket ( Buscape, in Portuguese ), and little does he know that his passion for photography would allow him to take his camera and look at his world through the eyes of a journalist who is able to capture on film what so many reporters had been craving for so long but were not able to capture. ... It's interesting that Rocket also is the narrator of his story throughout the movie."
Best Foreign Film of 2002,oonagimakii,1 March 2003,10,"Weinstein, where you at?  You should've snagged the distribution rights for this one.  Best Foreign Film of 2002?  No.  Best FILM of 2002? Yes.  No way should Scorsese be getting so much recognition at the nadir of his creativity.  Marty, YOU know this was better than your film.  Harvey, you know you regret not buying up this gem.  Academy, you're washed up. Politics make for strange artistic bedfellows.  Citizens, see this film."
Must watch!!!,romiel85,8 July 2010,9,"This title would sure send tremors down the spine. If you get your hands on the original reel ( which you should ), its very fast paced and does not matter at what point you start watching it, you would certainly find it intriguing. Though, I would certainly tell everybody to watch it from starting. Here are a few points which would tell you more about the movie: Interesting plot. Brilliant Screen play. Fast paced story, gives less time for audience to get out of the trance. Good amount of graphic content. Backed by fair enough acting. Dramatic events. Kinda motivational. watch it for yourself. I rate it handsome 9 points and recommend highly as a must watch."
scandal,michael-lynch-01,26 February 2003,,"I have just seen City of God and think that it is a scandal that the film has not been nominated in the best foreign language Oscar category. Few film (in any language) have come close to touching it in the past year. Also, Leandro Firmino da Hora should have been nominated in the best supporting actor category. I have known for some time that the Oscars were basically a meaningless business convention but now I also know that Hollywood rarely recognisesor acknowledges work of real artistic worth and merit. City of God is a powerful and relevant piece of contemporary cinematic art--see it now."
while still fresh in my mind.......,bgbdesign,6 March 2003,,"Quite a gritty orange tinted vacation I had in the slums of Rio. I could almost taste the dust and feel the heat in some of the scenes. A bit jarring to have a story told in an order known only to the director but I dutifully followed along as it tied together and everyone connected.I'm positioned by the camera  too close to faces of people in the apartment  and I don't like the smell of fear and sweat. While this repetitive tale was overkill on murder and machismo,I don't complain for some reason. Perhaps in my drive-through bank and sushi world this is what I needed to see in order to understand life doesn't change in the city of god,everyone dies and childhood ends when you can walk and hold a gun.A going away party and then you die...."
"Awesome movie, will keep you on your seat",sudhir-kesharwani,27 June 2021,9,"Loved this movie, shot really well and
The story is awesome."
One word: exhilarating,Generalle_della_Rovere,27 August 2012,9,"Fernando Meirelles' poignant and somewhat bittersweet debut ranks among the greatest and most iconic films to be made. Cidade de Deus delivers a rather terrifying narrative of a person caught in the middle of two warring drug mules. The film's transition from chaos to utter stillness, the real to the metaphorical, escalated the feeling of disorder, panic, and euphoria. Interspersed with the story are tales of corruption, greed, innocence, and the primal nature of man. The film showcased the very definition of character development, with the flawless screenplay mockingly fixed  on the first person account of the protagonist, every character experienced several surprising twists in their personalities."
City of God: The City Forsaken by God...,coffee_N_cigz,15 April 2005,10,"City of God will singe you like hot gun barrel...its gritty, painfully violent, heartbreaking, & void of any morality...Rocket has lived his whole life in the slums outside of Rio De Janeiro -- a place called City of God...don't let the name fool you, its the city forsaken by God...he meant for greater things says his brother & family...he's smart has potential to make something of himself & leave this 'hell' on earth...but can he keep his head down long enough & stay away from trouble?"
"Totally absorbing: ""To Live"" in the context of a drug war culture",niobe484,24 September 2004,9,"I rented this film with heightened anticipation mixed with hesitation: ""...brutality that makes the movie difficult to watch"" blessed with an 8+ rating. What a surprise..."
City of God?,Librartist2,10 January 2014,8,"Why was this area of Rio called ""City of God?"" I don't get it. Its obvious god never walked these streets or protected the children that lived there. It sure gives you another look at Rio. One that we don't see on the vacation brochures. Its very hard to imagine young children carrying guns and shooting other children in order to be part of a gang. It was a real eye-opener. And I'd like to know if the children in the movie were filmed live or if they were all actors? Did this movie receive any awards the year it was released?"
interesting,davepowers,29 November 2018,7,"I have to say I don't usually enjoy watching movies with only subtitles, but this one was so interesting I couldn't stop watching it. It was like a roller coaster of emotions."
Good film.,rokbaljak,1 May 2018,,"I liked the movie, the First half was perfect and the other one was ok. The only problem was the shaky cam that got kinda annoying. The movie gets a bit too dark. But no, I MEAN DARK AS YOU CANNOT SEE what is happening. Otherwise good character development and setting. 7.5/10."
Awesomeness,felis-43860,31 December 2021,10,"This movie is exceptional. It really is Love everything about it. The storytelling, the visuals, the characters, everything. Watch it! Do it now! I mean now!"
Takes Tarantino to School,stephan-9,5 November 2003,10,"This film takes Quentin Tarantino and Guy Ritchie to school about how they ought to be making their own films.  Every technique and trick those directors employ are done in City of God with equal aplomb, so the difference is in the content and context of the story.   City of God does not take place in a slick fairyland of well-manicured, clever hoods, and it is not The Young Ones with guns.   Where Tarantino's and Ritchie's films employ a cynical, ""I'm so much cleverer than you"" device, this film instead uses raw emotion.  City of God says to the viewer ""this world is real"" in a way which neither requires you be in on the joke, and without looking down upon your priveledged life as if to say ""you could never understand""."
"Finally, the Academy realise this film",Matrix99,28 January 2004,10,Why it is a need to label movies as category such as Art Film or mainstream film. The label of the film as art film at times frightened people
Rio fun,virgilx,13 February 2003,,"The movie was pretty close to mainstream fare if not for the foreign language, sort of Pulp Fiction (elliptical structure) meets Goodfellas (gang life story). Lots of interesting and flashy visual stylings that work well within the context of the story.  The movie breezes along, despite the many subplots and characters."
Best foreign movie,jameirkgolden,6 November 2019,10,"Absolutely one of the best foreign films I've seen of all time, It was also pretty emotionally interesting and kept my attention through the entire duration of the film.
City of God was honestly something that just invoked so many emotions and it also sheds light on poverty stricken life of the slums in Rio de Janiero but in the most artistic way possible I genuinely felt a connection as if I was living in the movie."
Impactful and transformative,janahes,16 August 2021,10,"This is an exceptionally beautiful film that has left its thumb print on my soul. I will never forget the first time I saw it, and the journey it took me on. In some weird way, I feel that my life and journey in film can be marked in multiple phases, one of which is life before having seen City of God and life after having seen City of God."
Cidade DE Deus,lucasgrm26,17 June 2015,10,"City of God is a masterpiece of Brazilian cinema, known throughout the world and giving evidence to the national cinema, and it is no less, with a dynamic and well structured language can expose a real story that had evidence across the country, but city of God goes beyond the history shown by the media, showing the social problems experienced by the black and marginalized population among the 60 to 80 showing the means that lead youth to crime, does not advocate or charges at any time, but shows reality crudely. The characters are well built, and in some cases even allow a psychological analysis, giving depth to the plot, involving from start to finish. City of God is a necessary film not only for movie lovers, but to all who wish to improve their social conscience and try to better understand the society we live in."
Do not fall for the hype.,rararana,6 January 2003,7,"You will hear raving reviews about this film.  ""Best film since amor es perros"" bla bla bla.  Let me tell you this film is good, but thats where it ends.  I recommend amor es perros.  Better still watch el mariachi if you feel like watching a film with south american latino flavour.  Otherwise just wait till this comes out on video, and perhaps on a rainy december night when u cant find anything else in blockbuster to watch rent it. It will be cheaper as well."
Felt like a documentary. It felt so real,michimimi,16 November 2022,9,"When I first started this movie I was not expecting this. The movie is a roller coaster ride one which might make you afraid for a little bit but you enjoy the ride nonetheless. The characters are well written and cudos to the actors because they did an amazing job. The movie was extraordinally made. From the start to the end it did great and it made a really good job in the themes it had. In the end it shows how life really is. This movie had me go through different emotions. Once again the cast was spectacular, the plot was great and the storyline gave all that it could've. This is a movie I will never forget."
Playground of Eden,ave_minerva,7 November 2003,,A beautiful tapestry of powerful characters interwoven intricately with each other to come up with a wonderful masterpiece. Each child has a story to tell. Each child absorbs us into their character's universe making us appreciate them as a colourful individual quite unlike the dumb dull adults we have to put up with in current affairs.
Plain and simple...,jdoehrman,15 April 2011,10,This is one of my favorite movies of all time (In my top 15 for sure). I remember seeing it at an art-house with my brother in 2003 and leaving the theater thinking it was the best film I had ever seen.
Quite simply one of the best cinematography of all times,bogdescu,23 April 2003,10,"Tremendous. Beautifully shot and performed, original, dynamic, juicy and humorous. This stuff has to be true, it has the paradoxal quality of truth. Three hours of pleasure."
One of the most frightening films I have seen. 9/10,bah_humbug,2 October 2003,9,I did not know anything about this film apart from it is Brazilian and highly rated before I saw it. After seeing it I was shocked and I am still stunned by the images portrayed.
Best Movie of 2003,marek420,31 March 2003,10,"Yes I believe that it was that good, at least out of the movies I have seen. The movie was unrelenting and gritty in it's portrayal of two friends and the path they choose. One becomes a drug dealer the other wants to be a photographer.Despite it's very serious and grim story, the movie manages not to be depressing. There's ample subplots throughout the movie, all of which are good. The acting, cinematography, and editing are all up to Hollywood standards (the acting is above most new movies I would argue) Really I can't say enough about this movie. It was playing in only one theater in all of Toronto, and I still went to see it."
"Stark reality: vicious, desperate, and triumphant",thedeepravine,26 January 2003,10,"Cidade de Deus is a portrait of Brazilian life on the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro, in the most downtrodden of places. From the euphemistic reference to the ""City of God,"" to the stark reality of gang life, this film shocks and inspires terror in the casual viewer, who is often far removed from the world portrayed therin. People wanting to escape reality, those favoring pedantic Hollywood escapism, need not view this film."
Tour De Force,thrashpilot,4 February 2004,,"Why did i feel the need to comment on this movie when there are already 240 comments recommending it? Well, i felt that some people missed the point... if there was a point. This was simply an exterordinary story. Set in several different decades. The direction of the movie was unbeliveable and the actors involved were some of the best to have graced the screen in years. (SPOILER) the part with the 2 crying children about to be shot was particually moving and the acting was worryingly good. I loved the story of the appartment and the whole experience left a room full of my friends lost for words. Hopefully this will pave the way for more 'big budget' films from outside the U.S. We are getting tired...."
Brutally Honest!,milhouse_van_houten,2 February 2004,10,"City of God is certainly one of the most exceptional foreign language films in movie history! The movie excels in every level.  The captivating camera shots make a truly fascinating cinematography.  Editing was brilliantly done with some Pulp Fiction influence added into it.  No single actor's performance particularly outshine the most, but the ensemble performance, from the street kids to the crime masterminds, is remarkably convincing! The screenwriter made the story so suspenseful, bold and daring, that you would not want to miss a single scene.  And the truly best aspect of the movie is its ingenious film making.  Watch out for the ""apartment scene"" where the genius director shows how one small apartment drastically transforms as its inhabitants change through the years."
The Other,prairiem,18 January 2004,,"My objection to this movie is political.  I believe that these conditions exist, I believe that the movie was well-made, I believe that the intentions of those who made the movie were to break open the situation and ask that it be addressed."
"Captivating, Charming And Realistic",theoriginalfps,4 June 2013,10,"I just saw City Of God a few minutes ago, i i felt like i need to write this review right away."
Brilliant,rjlong65,20 November 2004,,"This is a brilliant though deeply disturbing film. Certainly not for the squeamish or faint-of- heart, this movie has several scenes that can quite literally turn your stomach."
interesting vision of life,katatonic_ceremony,24 December 2004,7,"This film is an interesting creation, it has a good way of presenting the life that the people of Cidade de Deus have. It is brutal, hard and makes no difference to the small aged children, to the weak, or to the poor despite the name of the town ""Cidade de Deus"", City of God."
"If you run, the beast will get you. If you stay, the beast will eat you.",accelerius,20 July 2014,9,"If you cant stomach extremely realistic, gritty and dark shades in a film throughout its 130 minute run-time, its best you don''t watch this film. As there are some movies which showcase only the sunny side of life and dancing among the tall grass and pretty flowers, this one shows exactly the opposite. It presents the true story of a few boys during three decades, the 60's the 70's and the 80's in the most infamous slum of Rio De Janiero - Cidade De Deus (City Of God)."
This movie in effect is fast paced and hard to follow,gamesj,20 June 2017,7,"I have seen this movie only recently (2005) and it's easily one of the better foreign films I have seen. Actually, it's probably just about one of the best films I had ever seen."
worst movie ever,tommeke1,1 March 2004,,"Strangely some people like this movie, my guess is that it has only become popular because it is so not Hollywood. Critics seem to like it and that is always bad news. They don't watch movies like normal people do, they don't even like entertainment and think we should be punished for even watching entertaining movies, maybe this movie can be used to make Saddam talk, i mean i can't think of any crueler torture.I don't know if this evolution should be encouraged. This movie outraged me, i never ever hated a movie more (and this time it's not even from Lars van Trier) I've seen my share of shootings in movies but this definitely tops it, more then that, there is no way you can have any sympathy for any character involved, they are all rotten criminals, therefore it is the most perverse movie ever and the worst."
City of God,kaylarada,16 October 2017,10,"Directors Fernando Meirelles and Kátia Lund showcase the dangers of growing up in a lawless city crawling with gangsters and corrupted government, in their 2002 film City of God. The film underscores the reality of Rio de Janeiro's youth, and captures the experience of a group of young boys growing up in the slums of Rio de Janeiro. Juxtaposing the coming of age narrative of the group of young boys with the not so innocent gangsters creates an atmosphere of chaos as the two opposing figures fight for the viewers attention. The film often calls us to question, ""Why return to the city of God, where God forgets about you?"" In this lawless city, the every man is God because it's every man for himself—the gangsters are untouchable because they bribe the cops, and the civilians must decide whether or not honesty is worth the risk of death."
Utter Genius!,elias26,1 March 2010,10,"At first i wasn't to sure on how the film might be, seeing as it is number seventeen in the top 250, you can never be to sure on what your watching! The film is without doubt one of the greatest films I've seen, along side the infamous, Godfather and The Shawshank Redemption. The city of God, cannot only been seen as a metaphor for freedom, but more having the need to succeed and have ambition and dreams."
I liked it and Walter Salles(Central Station) too...,JGBrazil,24 August 2002,10,Brazilian reality has surpassed the majority of attempts to portrait it in fiction. The acceleration of social decomposition has transformed violence into a banality.
A major achievement through and through - it did deserve an Oscar!,Xanan,14 February 2003,10,"When I decided to see City of God at the London Film Festival last November, I was not expecting to hear at the film's introductory speech, that this film was in fact `one of the most anticipated screenings at this year's LFF'. After all, the festival was already well packed with sought-after films, such as The Quiet American, Bowline for Columbine, The Pianist, Dirty Pretty Things, or The Dancer Upstairs! However, I was immediately taken aback by the energy of the opening chase sequence, which powerfully and unexpectedly introduced the audience to Rio de Janeiro's most dangerous neighbourhoods, the ""City of God"" slum."
Master In The Craft Of Filmmaking!,khushcg,5 December 2021,10,What a masterpiece! Every style of every film department fulfilled what can uplift the audience to their desired vision. The film is mischievous in the gangster genre. It tells a true story in such a dramatic format that you like to watch what is concluded in the film. I also now understand why it has such a cult status; it deserves it.
RAW CRIME!!,debjitbiswas-90226,23 June 2021,9,"""Have you lost your mind? You are just a kid!"
man this film is good,aamon,11 July 2003,10,"it's one of the best films i've ever seen, that's because i love gang movies and this one hits the mark. it's characters remembers me of ""warriors"" but much more violent , with the ""pulp fiction"" movie style. all i can say is ""this movie is perfect"". hollywood, go home. hail this brazilian director. 10/10"
Well worth it,Jacob_roberts99,24 January 2003,10,"This is an excellent film.  Not because it is violent, not because it is trendy, not because it is a slowly growing cult film.   But because it represents all that is good in film making."
this has got everything,antona,19 January 2003,10,"This is one film that really is worth all the hype. It's quite hard to believe that the same people who like this also rave about lovely-looking but vapid no-brainers like LOTR. The characters are all believable and interesting, the dialogue succeeds in keeping the viewer up-to-date without forcing the message in a patronizing way, the plot is utterly gripping, the acting is just amazing...I could name so many other fantastic aspects to this film if I had to. Seriously, there is just no way you will not like this film."
The dawn of a new Era at Brazil Cinema,CboyMovieFan,8 November 2008,10,"For those that only know Brazil, from their beautiful women, hot summers, white sand beaches, here comes a picture to tell you about the real Brazil, where people are forced to live in shacks and hoods ruled by gangs, drugs, and violence."
one of the all time great films,matty-tildesley,19 October 2008,10,i rarely ever see a film that captivates and engrosses me in quite the same way that city of god did. almost everything from the intelligent directing to the fascinating story to the brilliant acting help to emphasize the vicious and desolate nature of the story and the situation the characters are in whilst still portraying an idea of hope. the story had me in shock and awe throughout whilst offering some intelligent twists and somehow leaving me feeling good at the end. this film has the power to take you through a range of emotions and feel as if you are actually in the city of god and it gives me hope to know that despite some of the dribble we see coming out of Hollywood these days there are still some people able to give us majesty outside of LA. it is a film that shows cinema has the potential to not just entertain but to produce art.
a great film,prohibited-name-1544,16 January 2003,,"This film is amazing, Hard to fault. Considering the actors are supposed to be real life inhabitants of the 'City Of God' their acting is excellent. it's a short review because i have nothing bad to say about it."
Worthy of all the praise!,Aporkalypse,19 July 2003,10,I had been hearing about this movie for months before I was able to obtain a copy.
A movie truly sent by God!,magnus-bergstrom,3 January 2004,10,"It is incredible how you can be surprised by some movies you see. You haven't  heard much of them, which confuses you after you've seen them and been totally blown away by the experience. ""Cidade de Deus"" is one of those films."
this film rocks!,buttzilla,18 July 2004,9,"I had been hearing about City of God for several months before actually seeing it, so naturally I expected great things from this film having heard nothing but great reviews from everyone else who had seen it before me. But really, this film exceeded all expectations"
A Brazilian classic,hatebreed,4 October 2004,10,"This movie proves that great movies don't need great budget, as long as they have great minds working on it. The way the story was told, the change in the order of the story, but in a way so that we can understand the story. It is totally awesome. Strong and intense, this movie gives us what to think. Clever choice choosing one of the best Brazilian actors to play Cenoura (Carrot), funny to see the actor who plays the arms dealer. Fine work the one from the amateur actor's, proving once again that it doesn't need great actors from Hollywood to make it a master piece. I hope Fernando Meirelles continues to make movies has good has this one. It is great to see a Portuguese language movie in the top box hit list."
One of the most powerful films I have seen,gobosox,13 April 2004,10,"I watched this film while I was in Italy as it is hard to find in the states. I only heard about it due to a Oscar spotlight on some cable channel and it peaked my interest. I viewed it with high expectations and was blown away by everything about this movie. The cinematography and script were great. Even the first time performances by the actors were impressive. However, most important is that I actually cared about the characters and story after the movie was over. Other good movies, such as the Lord of the Rings movies, were engaging yet during the end credits reality returns and you're back to your life. This is not true with City of God. The people, places, and situations are all real and the film really opens your eyes to a different life. Although graphic, the film is never gratuitous. Yet more sensitive people may not be able to view this movie. My only complaint is that it was a little slow in the very beginning and it took me a while to sort the characters out. The rest of the movie more than makes up for this flaw though. Definitely one of the best movies I have ever seen, and I implore you to give it a try if you have not already."
Captivating Storytelling Depicting Tragedy in Rio de Janeiro,BEnDR1985,24 March 2007,8,"While most people hail this film to be one of the all time greatest films of all-time I honestly couldn't understand it at first by looking at the slip-sleeve on the DVD. But after viewing the film I understood what the audience was experiencing. The story takes place in Rio de Janeiro, narrated by the main character Rocket. It depicts the intense crime problem in the Cidade de Deus (City of God). How his childhood neighbors and friends become his worst nightmares and enemies. He speaks of how he follows his dreams to escape his urban nightmare, of how he found love and barely was able to touch it, of how his life was threatened numerous amounts of times, and of how his brother was slain while he was still young. This is a story that some may not be able to handle, but most should watch. I highly recommend it to those who are interested in foreign films or films of a urban crime nature. While I would argue with most and say it is not the best film of all time, I believe that it deserves some higher ranking."
Greatest Movie you will probably See in your Entire Life!,Adolphe_Menjou,8 February 2006,,"the editing and directing is astound, you will be engaged by the plot. There's no need to get into a huge comment about it, it is simply the best movie you will probably see, definitely the best post 2000. So enjoy"
"Versatile, entertaining and City of God !",bannaohi,2 March 2018,10,"Simply, the best foreign movie in gangster category."
Nice movie,torhallurpoulsen,3 January 2007,10,I bought this DVD after reading the short-story on the back of the DVD-case. Must say I wasn't disappointed.
Good job,jordanbuntonwilliams-17957,19 December 2017,,This film will always be one of my favourite. I found this film to be very inspirational.
A Complex Story Executed Masterfully,AbenezerS,23 May 2018,8,"This is one of the few films I can watch repeatedly without losing interest . It's violent, romantic, and unforgiving. The setting is surreal The characters stories are interwoven and they interact in a way that feels realistic. The stories also jumps back and forth in time. It's very complex but because it's edited so well It doesn't feel overwhelming. It's really an amazing film! Pay attention and enjoy."
amazing movie,motezs,17 October 2018,10,"The film revolves around the, 'City of God,' a favela in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, it talks about the things that have happened in the past time and how it changed into a war and how those kids had the drug going in the town where they lived. There is a girl were she falls in love with the dealer and this movie talks about the culture and the things that they do in that town. Also, I am a big fan of foreign film, because its great to see directors with different points of view than the average American director. And the movie was holding in different language and that makes me think how cool to add a different language. I would recommend watching this movie it makes you look at things in different way and have a lot to do in actions. This movie shows us how kids can know a lot of things that not one of us would know or see."

A must see musterpice,yecheskelschwab,25 October 2021,10,"Over the past decade, I've seen this movie probably more than 10 times, and each time it gets to me. It explores some difficult, yet fragile topics, which are equally important now as there were 20 years ago."
"Run, run, don't walk!!",Pete-195,1 February 2003,9,Run to the cinema to see this one says Peter Bradshaw from The Guardian. I couldn't agree with him more!
Amazing,djohnsonc,12 January 2003,10,One of the most amazing films in the last ten years. Truly a work of genius and imagination. Makes you want to see it again just to look at the camera work and direction. A very important piece of cinematic work. I can't recommend it enough.
The best hood culture film of all time,gabewaltman,26 July 2019,10,This movie Somehow tops menace to society. A fantastic plot and brilliant narrative structure. Wavy plot=groovy times. Also lots of killing so bring your kids!!!
Insightful Film,sharbelbdawalibi,7 October 2019,7,"Many movies tend to have a cookie-cutter plot, but City of God branches out as an insightful film regarding life for those in more impoverished areas of the world. The struggles of growing up poor in Brazil is brought to a sense of realism in this film through the adventures of Rocket. There are many elements of violence throughout the film that accompany Rocket's mission to escape the crime life that rose from their impoverished upbringing. I felt like the violence of the film was what kept this film interesting and engaging, otherwise them film was boring throughout some scenes. There was also many times that I felt like the ability of children to use a gun or be as brave as they were during hectic scenes was very far fetched and unrealistic which made the film feel out of touch with reality."
One of the best movies I've ever seen.,jackzullo,1 May 2015,10,"Gritty, edgy, based on a true story. It's a movie that unfolds slowly in drastic character development, tying the audience emotionally to all of its characters."
Amazing but ...,kareem_tayyara,22 April 2022,8,"Everything in this movie is beautiful and wonderful, from the reality, the photography and the story, but the only thing that was missing from it the extra seriousness."
BEST MOVIE OF THE YEAR SO FAR!!!,Doorslizard,3 February 2004,10,When i hired the movie i din't had big expectations of it.I new i would not be so bad because it had won the BAFTA Awards and after i wachted the movie i was complete blown away off it.It Quentin Tarantino in Brazil.SO good is the movie and the young actors are very impressing.I did check on the site about the movie.And most of them had no actor experience or played in other movies.They probably live like this all the time so they don't have to act and just be thereselfs.So if you decide to hire some big Hollywood film or something in the videostore don't do it for one time in your live and look at a Brazilien MASTERPIECE :Cidade de Deus **** and if you want other good not american pictures then hire Amores Perros(director of the new movie 21 grams with Del Toro and Penn)Lola Rentt a german movie and for the once who have been sleeping there whole live Das Boot (but you probably seen this one already.The foreign movies are getting stronger buy the day no big budget movies but with little money.Hollywood watch out.
Watched so many times...Portugese is now in the vocabulary,godji-53416,19 February 2020,7,"Nothing bests the visual orgasms this film exhibits. The story grips and rips the realities of good amongst the evil. The dichotomy is never blurred yet the intimacy is unmatched to most films that portray gang modalities.
Maybe the GODFATHER. Tis all."
4 me... best movie ever.,mikopancio,30 September 2007,10,"I expect I'm not the only one who understood the way this film fill and complete all the emptiness that hide in each person. Plenty stories and a complex storyboard. Real stories that enter in what is the real world. It is not a cruel movie plenty of blood spreading everywhere, it's a documentary which have been also used to help those people, who where after all the real actors of this enormous story. ""Favelas"" stories. And because of those original Brazilians musics, the ambiance that surround the spectators appears real. And as ""Buscapé"" said at the beginning: city of god, was a postcard... Since it came out at cinemas I have met a very poor number of people that knows this movie... that's really a shame, because is the exact example of what every movie must be: OK, good the story, good the super special effect, good the image, the music and the acting, but most important thing is the message and ""city of god"" got this point perfectly. 10, excellent is because i liked the back stages, the movie, the music, the acting, the plot, the story, and every scene is perfectly filmed its a chef d'oeuvre!!!"
don't move there thats what i got out of it,MovieGamer69,21 April 2003,7,"well first off the film is very intresting being based on true events i just think that the violence is very stupid and unwarranted, i understand the point of showing it, im not against violence in films but it was very exploitative in that the end of the film almost every character is dead, this makes the movie hard to like for alot of reasons, i couldn't relate with the narrator at all and the character benny seemed like he was too cool and popular to be friends with such a stupid person like lil ze or whatever his name was, it just doesn't make sense if he was such a gangstar and killed all these people he would be so liked, also the kid killing was way f**ked up to watch i mean more so watching the kid get shot in the foot and cry while the other kid decided to kill one of them, come on this is like worse than gta, gangs of new york was a extremley realistic violent film, but this film had no morals or values killing was just so dumb and it made the movie dumb, if anybody could get killed, it made u just feel like rocket was lucky and at the same time stupid for living there.  Lets just say that the city of god is not somewhere u should move to based on children walking around with alot of guns and no books, enough said, seeing this movie was very painful in a honestly fustrated stupid sort of way"
Amazing experience,aidanmoran-36647,18 October 2021,9,"Vibrant and beautiful look into the broken city of Rio and the favelas surrounding it - brutally honest and matching in strong emotions and cruelty that enthralled me to the point I was dizzy with inertia - one of the greats - Brazil's ode to cinema, one of it's best since Pixote. To see the slow but steady growing of a man coming to terms with his identity in such a unforgiving city and finding love, sex and horror and shame everywhere he turns, it's easy to say that this captures feelings even the best of coming-of-age directors find difficult to achieve."
Reality,kauanasturmer,1 December 2021,10,"As I am Brazilian I can say, this movie is very precise to show our brutal reality. It is not all Brazil like that but unfortunately most of the favelas are, also it can open the eyes of the rest of the world breaking the stereotype that we have."
"City of God, the favela",kevog-39220,4 December 2021,10,"City of God, the favela for which the movie is named, is one of Rio de Janeiro's most notorious slums. Our narrator is a young boy named Rocket who leads us from the late '60's, when the favela is orderly rows of pre-fab housing for the poverty-stricken, into the early '80's when it has become a warren of bleak."
"City of God, the favela for which the movie",kevog-39220,4 December 2021,10,"City of God, the favela (squatter settlement) for which the movie is named, is one of Rio de Janeiro's most notorious slums. Our narrator is a young boy named Rocket who leads us from the late '60's, when the favela is orderly rows of pre-fab housing for the poverty-stricken, into the early '80's when it has become a warren of bleak."
Like Menace II Society on speed,absynth,31 May 2003,10,"This movie is definitely one of the best movies I have seen in the past years. Set in a ghetto suburb of Rio, it takes most of its quality from its unprecedented authenticity. I'm sure you all read the usual blubbering of the movie being shot (ha! the pun!) with amateur actors, so I'm gonna skip that."
Another foreign tragedy,aagold,6 April 2004,7,"The hype surrounding City of God has become enormous. It has obtained rave reviews here in America. Especially among the college professors and students that I frequently converse with. Unfortunately, this movie did not live up to the hopes I had for it.  Having already seen ""Harder They Come"" and ""All the Forgotten Ones,"" I assumed that this film was garnering so much praise because of a message that would go above what those other films portrayed. The cover of the DVD even has a quote mentioning how this would change my life. It did not. I personally feel both of the other films just mentioned did what ""City of God"" does, and with more originality.  This film takes a lot of modern movie concepts, especially those made famous by Guy Ritchie, such as interweaving plots and jumping to different points of time as the film progresses.  I highly recommend seeing those other two films before this one, and it should change how impressive it really seems."
Triumph in Filmaking,jessebogner,13 March 2003,10,"One of the finest films I've seen in years, and my pick for the best movie of the year. The Brazilian film City of God is a dazzling portrayal of the violent Rio De Janeiro slum `Cidade de Deus', which ironically translates to the City of God. In this terrible world of violence, we see the story of how crime progressed through the eyes of our protagonist the aspiring photographer Rocket. Amazingly, the film spans decades, and shows many intertwining stories, which could stand alone as great films. Fernando Mareilles created this movie exclusively with untrained actors from the village, and their real emotions make the movie that much more powerful. This visually stunning film, with incredible camera tricks not only amazes you with the cinematography, but with the strong ultra violent and ultra sexual themes caused by this drug culture. The crime saga is told in the same way Goodfellas is and in many ways just as brilliantly. The violence is as powerful as any movie since Apocalypse Now and watching this masterpiece gives you a very new outlook on the potential of modern film."
Everyone should take that bath of reality,gleich,3 February 2003,,"I'm brazilian, but I can't get shocked enough by how (too) many people live there. You see little boys as those sleeping in the street or under bridges, alone and stoned. You or at least anyone of your family have already been mugged."
"City of God, is among those films that stays with you in your mind, touches you in your heart all through your eyes.",Bitil,29 January 2003,10,"Sometimes it is more important to appreciate a film, rather than enjoying it. And City of God, is among those films that stays with you in your mind, touches you in your heart all through your eyes. This film is based on a true story and novel by Paulo Lins an insider who's lived in the neighborhood where God is silent and devil speaks trough the fire and guns. Fernando Meirelles doesn't make you cry throughout the film, because everything you see is far beyond expectations that wouldn't give you the second to think and shed tears. He makes you deeply sympathy with the characters because not only they are not trained actors, yet they are real people from Citdade de Deus (City of God), where the dreadful events has been taking place since one can remember. `There are two Brazils: Middle class and lower class, as two different worlds' says Meirelles who's from the middle class himself, `people of the middle class only hear about slums and the crime in other towns through press, nobody has ever made a film about them'. City of God broke the box office over Hollywood films such as Minority Report in Brazil, which is amazing for the Brazilian film industry. The only reason for this incredible success is because this is a film from the people for the people, by the people."
Images that can never fade,gerry-steele,23 February 2003,9,To say that 'Cidade de Deus' is anything less than a masterpiece is surely a travesty of free speech. Held here in this film lies a harrowing truth of life in the City of God. Through this film we feel the breath of gang leader Li'l Zé; a hood whose reign in the town land starts a war that destroys the lives of countless numbers of his neighbors.
authentic depictions of hard life in brazil 2-3 decades ago.,Ove_Oveous_Maximus,19 January 2003,9,"Let me first say that I had to wait literally about 6 hours to see this film.  All shows in New York city were sold out saturday night opening weekend.  But the wait was well worth it.  If you've never been to brazil and often found yourself dreaming of a visit, watching the City of God will definitely ticket you there.  Seeing this film will bring out emotions of fear, terror, and pity.  However, the story also considers and explores a culture of jubilee and sensitivity."
A masterpiece,welingto2003,6 January 2003,10,"This movie means to much to the brazilians. It opened our eyes to the problem of traffic and violence in the slums in a way never seemed before and opened the brazilian market to brazilian movies. The middle class in Brazil has a strong prejudice against people form slums and against the brazilian movies (they used to watch any hollywood comercial movies). More than 3 million people went to see this movie here and the press wrote many articles about it. I love cinema and I go to cinemas every week and I can say that ""City of God"" is the best movie of the year. Everybody should see it."
"Fully touching, and completely gripping",mgmtfilm,22 December 2009,10,"Every scene, character, and word in this film is near-perfect. the plot line presents something very rare in common cinema; something we have lost with everyday rom-coms and ugly punchlines."
Awesome yet Tragic,okibabe,23 February 2003,10,"amazing film. amores perros mixed with that old movie fresh. only difference between brazil and san francisco is that brazil acknowledges that they send all the poor people out to somewhere out of sight, out of mind. great storytelling and weaving. made me glad for being born here by chance. the joy of the single soccerball was uplifting in the u.s. age of instant tech gratification....until the jackass shoots it. one of the top 10 films i have seen in the last 3 years."
This movie is the kick!,rufferto,23 February 2004,9,"Makes Reservoir Dogs and Natural Born Killers look like Sesame Street. It is violent, yes, but there is no other way you could make a realistic movie about the Brazilian favelas. I had heard good things about the movie, but I didn't see it in the cinema. Yesterday I bought the DVD and I have already seen it twice! OK, it doesn't star Eliza Dushku, but that is the only negative thing you can say about it. Everything else is near perfect, be it direction, acting, script, etc. At times you do forget it is just a movie and that the people you are seeing are just acting. Great stuff, really ought to be in the top 10."
Gripping Crime/Gangster film,bandana-boy-z,11 September 2008,10,"Loud music, joyful screams, and fascinating cinematography drew me in to 'City of God' from the off. Although i did wonder what sort of 'urban crime/gangster' film this as the first scene involved a chase through the slums of Brazil involving a chicken and what i consider toddlers. The film soon picked up to harsh crime film that i was expecting."
Heavy,FilmConnoisseur,19 September 2003,9,"But who wouldn't expect that from a movie telling a story that involves kids killing kids. That aside, the movie stands above everything else in it's genre (War Movies) because it is a war Americans didn't care about, the masses still don't. It is awful, and you are disgusted from what you watched. After the credits start rolling and an important part of the movie is repeated from reality. It hits you. You can't breathe. How manny movies have restricted your oxygen. See it."
The one to go down in history books,Ono-Ovo,12 September 2009,10,"Perfection, a word that describes Cidade de Deus in the best way."
"A tale of a hopeless existence, beautifully shot",boba33c,4 August 2003,9,"This is a powerful film that is compelling from the opening credits with the unique ""chicken chase."" Instantly the absurdity of the people's existence in the slum is made apparent."
"When teenagers catch up on a hen, not by wood just by gun!",khoshi-88,5 April 2012,9,"Whoa. Such an amazing start; gangs of boys start catching up on a chicken with GUN!!!! What kinds of story we are going to face? This bewildering introduction, coupled with vigorous samba music, is a comprehensive plot of the movie. A violent neighbourhood of Rio de Janeiro where no police, no law, and no ethic is there: city of god. Doubtless, the Bráulio Mantovani's elaborated screenplay is one of a kind those does not ignore a smallest detail, so could easily form the logical sequences of story and relations between characters. Fernando Meirelles deliberately keeps himself away of going into drama or even tragedy, with not consuming so much time on the key scene of the movie, so the movie fellowship is really fast and keep on occupying the audiences' mind. Such an amazing of this style is the beginning of the Knockout Ned's story; the scene of attacking on his girlfriend, shooting on his family, and killing his brother and uncle is deliberately so short and sufficient. Eventually the death of Bene in his goodbye party, or even the scene of killing Li'l Zé follows the same strategy. Everything in city of god happens so simple, and it definitely is the strength of this movie."
Amazing,smiler_1973,8 August 2003,9,"A simply stunning film in so many ways, the story, the imagary not forgetting the emotion.  This film kept me riveted to my seat I just wanted more and more and was gutted when it finished.  A truly fantastic film telling the true life story in an original manner. A must see film for anyone"
WOW,a_theoha,26 October 2003,10,"This movie grabbed me, sucked me in, entrapped me in its marvellous story, complicated characters, visuals, and writing, and then threw me out again...begging for more. This movie could have gone on for ten hours and I still would have wanted more, that's how good it was."
The Best Brazilian Film,mellagi,5 October 2003,10,"Another world inside Rio, ""Cidade de Deus"" shows how people survive in a place where the ""official society"" visits just by the police or by the middle-class junkies. The rules are different, made by who gets power from the traffic. The great stories are accomplished with great edition and brazilian black music of the 70´s."
A GIFT FROM HEAVEN,DefBoNe,26 January 2004,,"Cidade de deus I just watched it. It blew me sky high. It was so good, I didn't want it to stop. It grabs you from the beginning to the end. City of God something to remember for a lifetime."
Visceral Violence in a Beautifully Shot Film,KramerTM,11 April 2004,10,"This movie sticks with you long after you leave the theater.  Some of the scenes are absolutely unforgettable because of the lurid violence that is displayed in a rather documentary-like format.  The cinematogrpahy and editing are simply brilliant.  The story, told in a non-linear fashion, hits you with a memorable scene and/or line at all the right times.  This film sets the benchmark one notch higher for ultra-violent dramas in the spirit of Pulp Ficiton and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.  The original part about this one (besides its rapid, jump-cut-style editing) is that all of the main characters are essentially children."
Excellent movie,AranhaHunter,21 December 2003,10,"This movie draws very strong similarities to Pulp Fiction in the way that the story is told and the camera angles and how the camera works. This is an excellent movie, very well directed and very well acted through, showing a bunch of young talented actors. If you in any way, shape or form liked movies such as Scarface, GoodFellas, Pulp Fiction, GodFather, give this movie a try."
"Powerfully real, without going overboard.",twelve_vacancies,8 June 2004,,"City of God is one of the greatest of it's kind. It shows how children in this lot can be effected at such a young age to become what is most feared. Some parts of this film are incredibly painful to watch, but it's not really the realistic violence, it's the situation. Almost documentary like, the acting is exceedingly good by these young amateurs. Similar to Gus Van Sant's 'Elephant' where the child actors are so real, that it doesn't even seem like acting. It never strays off to miss it's point, as well as the story. It does what it needs to do, in a unique way. I'd recommend it, for it doesn't glorify the lifestyle these children live, but it also doesn't really make them the villain either."
One of greatest movies.,dunatovkarlo,6 July 2019,10,Watching this movies I gained the impression about movies from Brasil. What a great movie this is. Everything is presented at the top level.
I saw all emotion.,etmkorkut1,9 May 2012,9,"I saw emotion in ""City of God"" hope,dram,revenge,betrayal,love... The movie take place in RİO(brezilya).Film's players are very talendet.Movie's child players aren't real actor and actress ,they are Rio's indigenous but they are good at acting.The film's scenerio is very good and real."
big No No,Monarad,4 October 2015,1,"I really don't know why this movie has ranked more than 8 on IMDb and it makes me disappointed that nowadays movies which show very dark sides of the world get nominated for so many awards. I don't say the movies should be all shallow but instead of spending so much money on this movie to show so many graphic scenes. It was better to spend the money to actually help these people in Brazil. I know that these things should get taken care of but a lot of children are getting killed in this movie and it is so harsh and not right even if a single child gets to be the victim of seeing these scenes , and making these kinds of movies cannot and won't do any good for them nor the people who are watching these. And besides the movie was so boring and everyone in the room pretended to like it to show themselves involved!!! A big No No.."
One of the best ever,presjerome7,19 August 2004,10,"First off, for anyone who has not had the opportunity to view this film please do not hesitate. I have given this film a perfect ""10"" rating and I will not do that often. Very few movies deserve that rating but this one is definitely one of them. For a first time director, his camera work comes off as almost flawless. For example, when showing the history of the apartment he uses beautiful technique. Even more importantly, the story is well told from beginning to end. The story is everything that you could expect from the likes of Martin Scorsese who is not bad company to follow. Overall, it was, without a doubt, the best film of the year when it came out. It simply radiates off of the screen in a way that few privileged films do each year."
Worthy crime film,Leviathan_6,30 August 2008,9,"This is a fantastic film about gang life in Brazil. For one thing, this film is visually stunning. The cinematography is gorgeous to look at. The camera motion and editing is relentless. This gives the film a raw, realistic feel, as if we are watching these events through the characters' eyes."
Extraordinary film with magnificant acting and photography.,szimmerman,19 February 2004,10,"This is an extraordinary film - with amazing photography and editing.  It is emotionally difficult to watch at times, but its searing portrayal of young men caught in a web of poverty, corruption and despair is beautiful.  The acting is superb.  The film moves at a pace that makes it even more poignant."
The way of storytelling makes it my favorite movie,schmickels,6 July 2019,10,"This movie portrays love and hate in a complex situation from so many angles. I've feared for the ""good characters"" and wished upon the death of the ""bad guys"", but in the next moment this movie makes you feel the other way around.
There are so many substories, some made me laugh, some made me cry.
If you are ok with violence, and want to see a movie where you can't go to the fridge if you want to keep up with the story, you will probably like this movie. Also it is in portuguese, which this movie made me realize is a beautiful language."
Really fantastic,sssss-96359,11 February 2020,9,I was shocked at the end of the story to find out it's based on a real event it's really violent
I'm Not a Fan of Violence & Gore But I'm Voting This Movie...,wishart188,17 September 2008,10,City of God was my first Brazilian movie. I didn't catch it when it was shown here in my country. But I sure did feel so glad that I managed to catch it on the DVD rental. Excellent.
Review and Editing,ptounas,12 October 2017,9,"The movie takes place in the 1970s in the poverty neighborhoods of Rio De Janeiro, Brazil. There are two main characters in the film; Alexandre Rodrigues better known as ""Rocket"",who wants to be a photographer who documents the drug violence in Rio, and Leandro Firmino better known as ""Li'l Zé"" who is a drug dealer, and who uses Rocket as his photographer to advertise his violence and strength. The movie mainly revolves around Li'l Zé and his strength and violence that he causes throughout the film from when he was a kid to where he is at modern time in the film. Throughout the film, it shows you how dangerous the streets are of Rio and the type of lifestyle they actually lived in during that time. The movie uses some interesting editing techniques throughout the film like parallel editing and cross-cutting in between scenes. This makes the film even better to watch, because it keeps your attention and makes the situations in the film much more interesting to watch. The editing in the film is well put together and captures your attention. The editing in the film also gives you a better perspective of when each scene takes place by the type of editing that is done. You can also see the cool editing from the beginning of the film. If you are into action movies and non-fiction films, I highly recommend this movie. If you can't handle violence then this may not be the film for you. Overall, it's a great movie based on a true story that will capture your attention from the beginning. This movie isn't in English so it presents itself like your watching an actual film from when it was actually happening."
Breathtaking,marymargaretmfavia,16 October 2017,9,City of God is the name of a city in the slums of Rio de Janeiro where this movie takes place. It tells the story of what its like living and growing up in a city where violence is common and drug lords had more power than the police.
City of God- SPOILER ALERT,alexanderlhorvat,16 October 2017,7,"""City of God"" directed by Fernando Meirelles and Kátia Lund is a story about two boys growing up in a favela in Rio de Janeiro. The boys both face hardships in their lives, but in diverse ways. One is aspiring to become a photographer, and the other is aspiring to become the drug kingpin of the Favela. Their lives intertangle, but eventually their lives take divergent paths. This whole storyline entices excitement and emotion through its cinematography. The image match between the raindrop falling off the leaf into a bowl with a fish swimming around in it with a bigger fish ready to catch and eat its prey. This symbol of predator and prey correlates to when the cops are hunting the teenagers in the woods for robbing a hotel. This technique helps feel the emotions of the characters in this scene. There are many scenes in this film which makes the audience feel the emotions of the characters. One scene that moved me was when Benny was shot by Blacky. The use of a close-up with strobe lights gives a chaotic effect visually making the viewer disoriented. This made the movie well worth the two hours and ten minutes. Another aspect is the amount of shown violence in the film. There is an exuberant number of adults and even children getting shot. This adds to the authenticity of the film, and in the end when the audience learns that this is a true story, that makes it even more compelling. I feel that this is a must see because it shows the hidden truths of areas in poverty that get swept under the rug. This film shines light on the problems that do not get much mention in the media. I personally did not know how bad the slums of Rio de Janeiro were until I watched ""City of God"". It is a great thriller and educational at the same time. I would recommend watching ""City of God""."
See City of God,leenamahlaoui,15 October 2018,8,"City of God is a beautiful telling of the story about Brazil's citizens, a photographer, and those who wanted to be the Lords in the City of God. It starts with a beautiful scene with people enjoying a party and making chicken. It is shot so that the humans seem almost savage and the audience beings to sympathize with the chicken that seems to know what is going on. In one sweeping move the chicken seems to out-think the humans and escapes. This is not done as most vegetarian commercials would, the audience does not empathize with the chicken, instead it flips the script and out maneuvers the humans, until it leads them to where they meet the main character. This movie does more showing than telling; in this instance, it shows the villain through the action-filled cinematography. The movie begins at this point, but this point is actually the end of the movie. Little motifs like this let the story come full circle without seeming repetitive. When a scene is first shown it tells one side of the story and when it comes back it shows you the other side, bringing the scene full circle. That means that the mise-en-scene has to be done perfectly, otherwise the scene is first shown it would expose too much. 
Another fascinating aspect is that the movie's narrator is not in every scene, however he narrates the whole movie. Letting other people's points of view be shown allows the audience to learn more about the movie without having to be told every detail, and this is done though the fact that the narrator does not reveal all aspects of the story. Similarly to these motifs I also do not want to give too much away; I believe you should see this movie because it takes a basic story line and does not end the way you may expect. Based on a true story this movie is too good to pass up."

Only three words can describe this movie...,ryan-173,26 January 2003,10,OFF THE HOOK!
An amazing film!,nanaaitana,16 June 2019,9,"Through this film they show us the harsh reality. How much people suffer from an early age and what they must do to survive. However, in some parts they exaggerate a lot without necessity."
Great movie,fsinayor-65232,26 December 2019,7,"I was hesitant to watched this movie at first. But ones I click and started watching, I got hooked up to it. its amazing and I will recommend it"
Masterpiece!,dimitris_andritsos,15 August 2019,9,"It's an amazing movie in which you can see how people react different when they live in poverty. We see how some small choices in our lives can change the latter and how thin is the line that separates the good from the bad. Same people, with the same stimulus, choose different paths for their lives because this option has to do with the character and not only with the environment. Of course, the mentions of the mighty things caused by the war are not less. Congratulations to the producers, to the director, to the scripter, to the actors and actresses and to all who contributed to this masterpiece"
Good,christinanmarget,11 September 2019,7,"Good, but wish it to be better in deal of story, like taxi driver, makes me remember it so much"
City of God is a cinematic masterpeice,seanpcarey-48035,7 October 2019,10,"City of God (2002), directed by Fernando Meirelles and Katia Lund is a cinematic masterpiece. The movie is a Portuguese language film with English subtitles. The cinematographer (Caesar Charlone) uses many handheld scenes from main actor and narrator Rocket (played by Alexandre Rodrigues and Luis Otavio) who is trying to choosing to become a photographer and not the life of crime and violence to action scenes, crane shots, low and high angles. The film depicts life in the gang filled slums of Rio de Janeiro barrio tackling poverty and despair with the innocence of children into crime. There are great editing (Daniel Rezende) and flashback scenes from unrest in the 1960's to when the movie was being set in the 70's and all flashbacks. The opening scene is fast paced editing leaving the audience in suspense of the choice of gang life, leaving to be better, or die in the gang infested streets. The actors and film location have many violent criminal scenes involving children and adolescents committing robberies, drugs, and murders. The mise-en-scene uses authentic street location the sounds of the city, natural light, along the use of blue colors to represent cold (death) and flashbacks in a yellow (hope) to represent warm. City of God gives it audience an inside look of gang life, poverty, corruption, violence, and greed.
City of God is a critically acclaimed film nominated in four academy awards categories for directing, adaption, cinematography, editing. I give the movie 10/10 for the story line, lighting, music, narration, cinematography, editing, directing, and acting."
One of the most action-packed thrilling films based on a true story,edgarjvallejo,7 October 2019,10,"Cidade de Deus or City of God is a film from 2002 based on the true story following a photographer's life story. This film is packed with action and some breath-taking acts of violence. I wouldn't recommend watching this film if you are squeamish especially because this is not like a regular action movie that has fighting scenes,this movie is full of murders in cold blood. The movie shows the formation of a gang by a group of kids who lived in the slums of brazil in a town named city of god which is not suit for it as there was nothing godly about it. When the story begins it follows Rocket and his brothers' gang as they started with minor crimes such as theft, but they had one rule, no murder. This soon changed when they went to rob everyone at a motel. Later in the movie you see how the evil nature of the youngest of the group comes out in this scene. This scene shows how even a kid can become evil in a matter of seconds when given the power. He later becomes one of the biggest Hoods (gangsters) in the city of god by working his way up to become the most powerful man alongside his best friend who was with him from the beginning. This movie is filled with mise-en-scene such as all the scenes of violence drugs and guns. This added to the movie by showing the audience the true status of this new city and how guns and drugs brought violence and death into their town. This is a good example of a realism film because it is all based on the actual events from the 60s. This movie is absolutely worth your time not only for entertainment purposes but also so that you can educate yourself about other parts of the world outside of the united states and it allows you to learn the history of one of the most violent places on earth and you see how it came to be and how it only takes a few people to create a full out war in a town that was meant to be a place of peace and new beginnings."
Very disturbing scenes for any decent human beings,e_konoval,16 October 2007,3,"I would like to share my opinion with those interested in watching this violent film. If MIRAMAX films aims to draw attention to the crime and drug problems of the poor neighborhoods of Brazil, they should not use these kind of shocking portrayals of violence against children, total disregard of taste, and association of sex with violence, drugs, and criminal activity. If one was really interested in solving Brazil's desperately poor and criminal gangs, government-sponsored media should be used, (the raising of) television commercial adverts, political action, and the use of Red Cross Society and Amnesty International. The awful aspects about this movie are that young children are shown being frightened and subsequently shot by gang-members, black children owning guns, and the association of sex and lust with crime. After that, the (general) public is appalled at the number of incidents of child violence and child pornography being distributed on the world wide web. Films like these should be reviewed by a special committee for their quality and their degree of taste of delivering the message they sought to deliver. In my personal opinion, there should be no room for such sort of films that contain raw and barbaric portrayals of violence, bullying, and humiliation in civilized society, in order to prevent the very idea of turning to violence among the desperate poorest of the poor."
A stunning movie where you would enjoy every scene,salmanalajmiusa,7 October 2019,10,"City of God is a masterpiece movie in sound, editing and camera movement. I gave it 10/10 rating. The movie is based on a true story. First of all, the sounds in this movie make you live the story. The use of fast paced music in the beginning of the film increases the tension and grabs the audience's attention. Also, the film starts with a sound of knife sharpening which introduces the audience to the world of violence and drug dealers. On the other hand, multiple flashbacks were used in this film to tell stories of some of the characters from the beginning. I liked the use of counter clock pan camera movement around Rocket which suggested that we will go back in time where he was a kid. The use of a tracking camera was needed a lot and was well used as this movie has a lot of running away scenes. The use of different camera angles was well done by the director. For example, most of Lil Dice's appearances were low angle shots because he was dominant. Except for the one where he was killed where we saw him in a high angle shot which meant that he was inferior."
A raw depiction of Rio De Janero's slums,arhamkhan-69543,7 October 2019,6,SPOILER ALERT
Review of Cidade de Desus,kasandravelasco-99486,7 October 2019,5,"City of Gods, directed by Fernando Meirelles and Katia Lund, tells a story of life in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in the area known as the City of God. This is an area of high crime and where drug dealers are running the streets, and where children are more interested in playing with guns rather than playing with balls. This movie shows how children killing other children is something normal. The movie does a fascinating demonstration of mise-en-scene, especially in the opening scene of a knife being sharpened on a rock to depict the danger of the area. This becomes significant because its a representation of how anything is used as a weapon in the City of Gods.The headless chickens are another mise-en-scene to signify the children running around causing chaos with their guns while the chicken that escapes is a representation of Rocket, who is looking for a better life outside the City of Gods.Throughout the movie there are fascinating shots utilized. An example, low angle shots are used to present the children stomping through the streets causing chaos. In these low angle shots their bodies are seen as silhouettes which shows faceless children who lives mean nothing. Another low angle shot is the children shooting the chicken to indicate power. There are many close up shots, one is the close up of Rocket and Lil Ze to display Rockets hatred towards him. Slow motion is utilized to Represent Rockets fear of Lil Ze when he is standing in the middle of the street between the cops and Lil Ze. There is also significance of color tones from going to a dark blue color which indicates fear and hard time to a yellow color which indicates calmness and happiness."
City of God,lucy-clark-99653,7 October 2019,8,"City of God is a breath taking crime thriller based on the true events in the slums of Rio de Janeiro in the 1960s, through to the 1980s. The storyline follows the life of the character Rocket (Alexandre Rodrigues and Luis Otavio), who is unintentionally involved in this moralless society trying to fulfil his dream and passion of being a photographer."
Violence within the slums,dinanashed,7 October 2019,8,"In the City of God, the movie follows the violent events that occurred in the 70s and 80s in the slums of Rio De Janeiro as the town that is torn by drug lords fighting to establish their value and killing innocent individuals along the way. The movie begins with the main character, Rocket, walking with his camera as Li'l Dice's gang approach him while chasing after a chicken. As he is walking, the shots momentarily stop, and the sound of a camera shutter is heard. This non-diegetic sound is to emphasize Rocket's view from behind the camera as his interest in photography is a significant part of the plot. Also, the mise-en-scene makes it clear that events that will follow this scene will be laced with violence as the gang is chasing after a harmless chicken with guns. As the movie continues on, there is up-beat music throughout which reiterates the constant fast-pace of the events occurring. This is especially true when the gang members run to attack another group which allows the audience to experience the adrenaline that is driving their actions. The plot overall is intriguing because the movie follows the simple life of those living in the slums and the impact that the violence due to drugs has on them. Though a very violent movie, it is cinematically appealing as the characters do not shy away from showing full emotion such as when the young child was shot in the foot. The ending of the movie is intriguing when Knockout Ned was killed, as it is revealed that there was a sub-plot within the plot of the movie because the connection is made with the bank robbery that occurred before. This is the beginning of the end, as the gangs dwindle down as they fall victims to each other."
*SPOILERS* Mini Film Review,paigeksmith-99994,7 October 2019,8,"The City of God overall told a good story, with great cinematography. From the use of angles, lighting, acting and the shots, this film was made by very skilled directors. Some of the most prominent angles and shots in the film are those taken from Rocket's camera. We can see the shots of Lil' Ze's gang from Rocket's camera, which is significant to the plot line, but also shows the gang in a light of power. With his camera, Rocket is able to see gang members, their weapons and gain access to their hideaway, which makes his camera such a crucial part of the film. Rocket's camera also gives us images of the cops letting Lil' Ze go through the angle of a patterned window. The most significant camera angle in the movie has to be the very end when the runts shoot Lil' Ze. While this is foreshadowed in earlier in the movie, the viewers actually see the damage the runts did. When Rocket captures these images of Lil' Ze on the ground, it shows him at a low angle and a canted angle. The low angle signifies that Lil' Ze is no longer in power and the canted angle shows Lil' Ze's disturbed personality and the mess he created.
The use of flashbacks is also crucial to the story. The audience begins watching the film with a chicken running in the streets. Viewers see a boy stranded between a gang with guns and cops with guns. Here, the audience learns about the narrator and main character of the story. At this point, we can see where the entire story begins through Rocket's flashbacks. Flashbacks are critical in this film because of the way Rocket tells the story. He gives a hint to specific characters and how they will enter the story, as well as how many of the characters crossed paths before the town breaks out in a war. The flashback is used again when Lil' Dice sees his brother fleeing town. When Lil' Dice's brother demands Lil' Dice give him some money, we see Lil' Dice's first act of power. The flashback shows Lil' Dice at a high angle to show Lil' Dice in a position of power over his brother. The film shows Lil' Dice pointing a gun at the camera, showing the last view of Lil' Dice's brother. This scene in particular seems ironic because it is an open frame shot, yet Lil Dice has his brother trapped under the power of his gun. The contrast of power in this scene shows the beginning of Lil Dice's sociopathic, power-hungry life.
During Benny's farewell party, it's clear that Lil' Ze is jealous when Benny hugs Rocket. When Lil' Ze pushes Rocket to the ground to keep him away from Benny, he is shown at a high angle. Lil' Ze looks down on Rocket to show that he is full of power. Right after this act of anger, the strobe lights come on. Lighting is important because the strobe light makes it visually difficult for the viewer to see what's happening between the characters. It adds some suspense to the scene and the music in the club changes from laid back to more intense dance music. The audience can see that Blacky is hiding in a circle of people and then throughout the few strobes that he took out his gun and fired it. With more strobes, the audience sees Benny fall to the ground and then hears diegetic screams and the music goes silent."
Violent yet insighful!,asmaticc,7 October 2019,7,"SPOILER ALERT
Fernando Meirelles' film, City of God, depicts a violent survival of young men in Rio De Janeiro in the 70s. The bloody film features action packed murder due to violent drug crimes from two perspectives, one of the drug leader ""Lil Ze"" and one from the aspiring photographer Rocket. This film touches on the traps which poverty lays for people born into these slums and how they must be involved in such crimes to stay alive, as getting away is nearly impossible.
The director did an excellent job with the mise-en-scene throughout the film, he opened the filmed the same way he closed the film and sandwiched the stories of each character in the middle. By giving a peak of what was going to happen in the end, it invoked curiosity and forced you on the edge of your seat throughout the film! The role which the photographer played was done phenomenally, he was made out to be almost a shadow most of the time and when he clicked the images, the iris shots of him doing so made the viewer feel as if they were witnessing history in the making!
The sounds and images accompanying each scene where quite fitting and appealing, one remarkable on in particular was the murder of Benny at his going away party. As the strobe lights flashed and pumped up music played, he was in a quarrel with Lil Ze about leaving when his murderer shot his gun and killed Benny instead of Ze. The fast strobe lights showed the parallel of how fast one's life in the slums can be taken no matter your status.
This film was a remarkable recount and representation of history which deserves to be shown. I would definitely recommend watching it if you don't mind some violence."
City of God,kaileycparnello,15 October 2019,7,"Fernando Meirelles and Katia Lund's 2002 film, City of God, is based off of true events that took place in the slums of Rio de Janeiro during the 1970s. It perfectly illustrate the life of the people during this time. It uses breath taking violence and crime to capture the constant stressful life style among the people of Rio. City of God uses violence from the start to the end. The opening scene there is an extreme close up on a knife being sharpened. This sets up the theme for the rest of the film.
The slums that the film takes place in is known as the City of God. This film looks into growth of the two young men throughout their life and the drastically different life paths they go done. Rocket has always had a passion for photography. He uses these skills to get up close and personal to document the violence. One of the main men Rocket is documenting is José ""Zé"" Pequeno also known as Lil Zé. Lil Zé is worked his way up to be one of the most powerful drug dealers around. The film shows the extreme violence and ruthlessness that he used to get his power. It brings to light the effect of violence and poverty on the youth during this time. The movie ends with an epic war between the drug lords that results in massive casualties. Ironically the children that gave Lil Zé power are the ones that end up killing him."
The City of Kids,rossmccormick-35396,16 October 2019,8,"The City of God, directed by Fernando Meirelles, displays the violence and hardships that are faced in the slums of Rio de Janeiro. Fernando captures the selfishness and greed that thrives in the slums through the eyes of Rocket- a developing character that is custom to the ins and outs of the horrific lifestyle that exists within the City of God. The hectic fast paced lifestyle of the city is displayed though the use of many different style shots. Most of the shots in this film have movement in them. We see this in crane, zoom, handheld and many other shots that depict that to survive on the streets within the slum, you have to be up to speed. Through the jittery mind of Rocket we get thrown between different times and occurrences by the use of flashbacks. From a time when everything was simple for Rocket playing with his friends, until he was in the depths of a city that throws around pistols and drugs like candy. Most of the film's shots, audio, and lighting was created to showcase the dark lives of kids that are relentless criminals and addicts. Many shots contained low key lighting and back lighting to portray the darkness living within the slums. The selected violence and gruesome shots grab the emotions and hearts of the audience. Few want to get out of the bad environment while many want to thrive and rule within it. This causes many conflicts for the growth of the city. I would rate this film 8/10. Its fast pace and ability to jump between time periods to build suspense will leave you on your feet. It keeps you curios as to what will happen to the reckless kids that rule the city."
Overrated crap,Tenymand,2 April 2021,2,"Poor acting, no script, emotionless, poor directing. I don't find anything good in this movie. Sad example of movies which people rate high because other did too. So called anchor effect."

GENIUS,henriharrisonpearson-57351,11 December 2019,10,"The city of god is a genius film, genius director, it really gives an insight into the life of Brazilian crime."
A masterpiece,karinamacedogomes,1 February 2020,10,"Talking about brazilian movies, Cidade de Deus is one of my favorite ones. I can't explain how much this movie is shocking till these days. The reality is showed with a really impressive naturality, but in the same time, all that you are seeing in that video is cruel.
By the way, this is the reason why this movie is such a masterpiece. It involves us since from the beginning, and you realize scene after scene how amazing (and sad) this is. This movie ia a real brazillian piece of work.
All of you must watch it at least once in life. I can tell you for sure, you will not regret."
A must see!,shanmur,13 August 2004,10,"City of God, one of the best films I have ever seen in my life and I have seen a tone of movies. It maybe because it is truly unlike any other film. Considering it is a foreign film, one must suspect that it is not the regular spill we see in theaters coming out of Hollywood. It is a crime film and the story about the ""favela"" (ghetto in Brazil), shows little kids who in the real world are not so little. Forced to live in a community where they have no escape and are forced to fight their way out. Violence and language in the film only add to show the realism of the film since it was based on events in the area. Brilliantly filmed and well deserving of academy awards. Highly recommended to anyone wishing to see what real life third world ghettos are like. Not like any gangster, crime film you might be thinking of comparing it to."
truly amazing!,zanglerska,16 December 2006,10,"this is, without a doubt, one of the best constructed films i have ever seen. it leaves you breathless, staring at the screen, just trying to collect yourself. yet, it is difficult to watch, and that is due to the unwaivering realism of the picture. unbelievable film."
review,johnjosephvirgin,24 April 2020,10,One great movie! superb. i recomend it to be watch. 10 star rating for me. great actors. great director. great setting
One of the finest examples of cinematography.,sagnikacharyya,21 July 2020,9,"A film which shows the slums of Rio, the society, mentality ethos of the Brazilian society and culture from a common man's point of view. Nothing could be more connected to reality. Based on true events,Fernando Meirelles has done a stellar job potraying the drug cartels and business going on added with the corruption and media fighting to grab a piece of this for their individual survival.
The stunning cinematography keeps it as close to reality as possible, keeps you glued to the screen the whole time. You develop a sense of empathy for the characters given their natural performances.
And you leave with a sense of Brazilian culture and society that is prevalent around those parts of the country.
A must watch for every film lover."
GOD OF CINEMA,umeshshrikant,3 August 2020,9,"A rustic crime genre handled with gruesome reality. amazingly treated and a well driven craft. how many times you watch it, you will always find it intriguing."
I mean... it's a Brazillian film about Brazillian stuff.,nathanstitt,9 March 2018,6,"To put it simply, the cinematography was meh, the editing was good meh, the narrative was alright meh and we shouldn't be licking Meirelles' balls and saying it's an ""enlightening spectacle"" just because it highlighted typically unreported-on foreign problems."
Intense Story - City of God,jacquelinempezan,9 October 2020,10,"Meirelles does not prepare his audience for the cyclic violence and unending tragedy within the film with the name City of God. Meirelles, however, wastes no time to force his audience into the violent and dangerous slums of Brazil. From the beginning of the film, the audience experiences an array of cinematographic techniques from high contrast lighting to non-diegetic sounds and narration. The reality of Brazilian culture, apart from the highly trafficked tourist areas of Rio, is established in this film. This film does an excellent job of highlighting the extreme poverty within Brazil with the diegetic sounds of traffic and clashing knives used to represent violence. Non-diegetic narration from the main character, Rocket, establishes some character security, for the audience, along with highlighting his importance. By the end of the film, I found myself enthralled in the unraveling events of Rocket's life. The sounds in this film were nothing less of grotesque and chaotic and greatly attributed to the visual story. The opening scene is the first of many instances throughout the film, where Meirelles attempts to make his audience uncomfortable. In my opinion, this film brought awareness to the public about the brutality in the city of god. The samba music does an exceptional job of sweeping the audience away and plunging them into Rocket's (the main character) world. He does this to note the significant moments within the film and ensures that the audience does as well. I was captivated by the life and death, the rise and fall, of each of the characters and often found myself anxiously anticipating their fates. Meirelles's storytelling masterfully brings awareness to the reality of the City of God to those who do not recognize the reality of it."
Brutally truthful and incredibly made,jmugg-22428,10 October 2020,9,"City of God shows the brutal and honest lives of people living in Cidade de Deus on the outskirts of Rio de Janiero. Over the course of several decades, we see the growth of gangs and drug cartels in the city. The film, based on a true story, is told by Rocket, a young man trying to become a photographer who documents the violence in the City of God.
The film draws you in with excellent cinematography and use of sound. Part of what makes the movie seem so literal is the use of ambient sound. The shouts of people in the city, the noise of vehicles passing, and the occasional sounds of violence give the film an extra level of realism. The narration by Rocket also adds an interesting layer. They way he starts at the eventual climax of the film, then returns to tell how things began gives it a story telling feel, as if Rocket is explaining how things got to this point. When new characters are introduced, the narration will tell their names, but explains that they will become more important later, making sure that the audience keeps them in mind for later. The sound use in City of God makes the film the narrative masterpiece that it is.
Another part of the movie that makes it feel more real is the cinematography. The quick, jerking cuts during action and more even shots during slower parts gives the film a documentary style feel, as if the camera is a person experiencing the brutal day-to-day action of the film. When situations become tense, framing of the scene tightens, begins cutting faster, and build great suspense for action. When the film slows down, the shots become more stable and lets the audience take in the story.
City of God is one of the best films about the struggle of people in lower status. Honest and extremely brutal, it is a must see for anyone interested in realistic films."
Rio In Ways You Never Knew Existed,nessnekkio,11 October 2020,9,"Think to yourself for a moment this question. What chance do children have of succeeding while living a life of poverty and criminal influence? Almost slim to none. City of God lets you know right away given the hard life in the Brazilian slums that almost no children in the film can live an honest life without the temptation of being engulfed by a life of crime. The character Rocket, the non-diegetic narrator of the film who is a wannabe photographer that got his wish of becoming a full-scale photographer was still involved within the drug dealing culture of the slums as he watches his brother and close friends die one by one because of greed, power, and very bloody money. Because the director's choose non-professional actors that actually live in the slums in Brazil, every actor portrayed a chillingly accurate representation of criminal hierarchies and gang culture. One scene specifically involves a child expressing his manliness by describing what he sees adults doing around him, which is taking drugs, robbing, and owning a firearm. Which speaks volumes into letting you know the sad realization that these children are doomed to repeat and replicate the violence and gang warfare they are so accustomed to."
you'll never buy another gram of coke...,dwyerbiz,22 September 2006,10,"no movie better explains the drug trade in Rio and what it does to its society -- from macho teens to corrupt police to even eleven year old kids . You won't believe what this one kid admits to doing, as if he were describing a cool video game. The movie was unbelievably good, but the special features were even better. we stayed up until 5am and couldn't turn it off. one of the most inspiring pieces of work i have ever experienced, both in film or in literature. I work at customs and this has served as an excellent reference for my work. If you use cocaine and you see this movie you will probably feel so guilty you won't even need to go on rehab, you'll just dump the crap down the toilet and join the peace corps or something. i'm serious, this movie will affect you."
City of God - the power of diegetic sound,rhysalexanderatay,12 October 2020,8,"The diegetic sounds at the start of the film allow the viewer to quickly learn the high tempo and intense nature of the film. The overlapping sounds and inability to focus on one simple environmental noise, as well as the fast cutting between camera shots, clearly shows the viewer that they are about to view a high action movie.
The film does contain many points of non-diegetic audio throughout through its use of narration to explain all of the characters and allow the viewer to keep up with the pace of the film as it moves through all of the characters different stories. At some points in the film non-diegetic music is also used to contrast the highly explosive action scenes with much more calm scenes. The music provides a powerful contrast into the two sides of some of the characters lives with the slow and passionate side, against the wild and intense lifestyle they live.
Many of the scenes throughout the film appear to have very naked sound, however many minor sounds also appear to be amplified. This is effective as it could suggest the alert nature of the characters due to the situations that they are in. Their position in life means that they must pay attention to everything and all noises in case they are signals or warnings. Silence is used very rarely in the film too, which further pushes the intensity of their lifestyle and highlights that they are never at peace in the City of God."
Stuning,mattcarlson-96710,12 October 2020,8,City of God shows the brutality of living in the outskirts of RIo De Janeiro. Throughout the film you see the growth of crime and drug dealing through the years and this shown by a photographer named Rocket who wants to tell the city's story. One of the parts of the movie that makes it so realistic is the audio with the sounds of city life and then the different pictures of the city really lay out the setting but also you can hear and see the crime and violence taking place. Throughout the movie you are drawn to the debilitating crime and how it affects people's livelihood. This film has a real sense of realism to it and it could be disturbing to watch at some points because of the violence. But the fact that this is done by a handheld camera it makes it even more realistic.
A Portuguese masterpiece.,elad-6,19 November 2004,10,"Even though I'm a guy who doesn't like watching movies whose speech is in languages other than English/Hebrew, I had no problems watching this intense Portuguese masterpiece, with subtitles of course. ;)"
Spoiler Alert,abigailckobal,12 October 2020,7,"I am not going to say I hated City of God, because editing wise, there were some really great things. However, this would not be a film I would watch again. Two things that led to my overall negative feelings of the film were the plot and the overall look. I found myself confused throughout the film's plot and the quality of the film seemed poor such as the graininess. At times, the plot did not make a lot of sense for me, and the handheld camera techniques added to this feeling of anxiety and confusion. To me the plot did not make sense at times and I noticed the camera would be shaky or a little bit messy. To me, it looked and reminded me of a low-budget film. I found out that the budget for this film was $3.3 million USD which might seem like a lot, but even lower budget film ranges from $70-90 million (Parlay Studios). However, one could argue that it makes the movie feel more authentic to the subject matter and the setting. The movie uses some editing techniques that I found to be really great. The transitions between scenes were excellent. My favorite scene was when the two boys were in the tree in the beginning and sweat fell onto the leaf. The droplet of sweat falls and the scene transitions from that to a fish about to be eaten. There is definitely a metaphor about how these boys are ""swimming with the big fish"" after committing this big heist. It was just so beautifully done. The film used lots of diegetic sounds. The three top sounds that the movie used the most were screams, music, and gunshots. The music really added a sense of lightheartedness at times through the film. My favorite was when they had played Kung Fu Fighting by Carl Douglas. Overall, even though I would not watch this film again, I think it did a great job showing the story of what happened in the Slums."
Greatest and most inspirational movie ever!!!,SmellyNapalm99,8 February 2014,10,"City of God is a bloody, exciting thrill as much into the life of a ""favela"" as it is into the lives of the youths who inhabit it. Although the bulk of the movie narrates the all-out turf wars between two rival drug dealers, the story is told with the energy, liveliness and enthusiasm of a child's tale, somehow managing to leave us hope amongst the corpses as the credits roll."
The most incredible film,Adam_the_brave,8 January 2005,10,"I was very sceptical when I first put this DVD in my player and began the film, not because I hadn't heard that the film was brilliant but because i had heard the film was all in sub titles. Now the idea of a fantastic film for me is one where u get totally drawn in and so immersed in the film yet I believed that i wouldn't be able to do this if i was having to read to understand the plot. I couldn't of been any further incorrect. This film is amazing. The plot, the shots, the camera, the direction, the script, the acting absolutely everything about this film is very very impressive and from a media student point of view the editing was of such a high standard that i personally hadn't witnessed before. I agree totally that the film is shocking violent and brutal yet i think anything less and this wouldn't of been the film that it is. The shock factor is only a shock to us as we don't experience situations like this, yet in the setting from which the film is shot from it is common everyday practise. I think one of the most successful aspects of this film is the fact that it sticks true fully to what life really is like in the Brazilian slums, the temptation is clearly there for over exaggerated crimes and police chases yet the temptation is not pursued. All in all i think that this is a truly fantastic movie and one which en captures its audience and forces you to take notice. If you haven't watched this film do so and if u have watched this film watch it again its just as amazing second time over."
Godly Work of Brazilian Cinema,ReflexAlex,7 June 2022,8,"Having heard seemingly nothing about this movie besides it's high praise and rating prior to watching it, I can say I've been very much pleasantly surprised by what a bonanza of Brazilian film making this is!"
A South American Masterpiece,CortlandHill,23 May 2017,10,"This movie was beyond amazing, any and everyone should watch it! The journey that viewers are taken on via the main character is mind blowing... this movie is literally like bringing a dope book to life! Easily one of the greatest films I've ever seen. Also, the way the film crew takes you back the era of the movie is awesome. Before you watch this movie make sure you go to the restroom because you will NOT want to pause or stop this one."
"Well Directed, horrific Eye opener!!!",Scottys3k,15 January 2003,9,"This film was 1 of my first foreign subtitled films that i have ever seen in the cinema... I am usually quite sceptical about these types of films, as i feel that they seem 2 take your viewing off what is happening in the film"
Film was a great film showing you the ins and outs of a gang war but......,christianjuns,25 September 2007,8,"I do not see any creative genius in it at all. What am I saying? the director took the same approach to this film from another great American director, his name is Martin Scorsese in Goodfellas. Why was this film not as critically acclaimed internationally as this film? It had the same approach, all narrative from the main character, both the films had that one guy who always seemed like the obnoxious ring leader, both movies were based on a true story, both films were made into a movie from a book, both had a sick ending plot, both told the story from the middle, beginning, and then to the end. this film my have been influenced by Martin, but do not compare it to American films saying that this is fresh and new and something we could never produce."
In the top five of all time,brucethomson-26510,1 June 2021,10,"Without a doubt, this movie is a towering achievement. It hits you like a freight train with its wholly unique form of style, brutality and general detail in the appalling lives of a group of people who choose very different life choices. It also shows how privileged most of us are compared to people who have to steal and shoot their way in order to survive. 11 out of 10."
Flawless,znmo,6 February 2007,,"This movie could very possibly be the best movie I have ever seen. There is seriously not one flaw to this movie and plus, this movie has nearly everything that could possibly make a movie great."
What is the message here?,vavigof,17 December 2021,7,"One of the taglines for City of God is 'Fight and you'll never survive. Run and you'll never escape'. Even though the film emphasises that a life of crime is inevitable in Cidade de Deus, the fact that its narrator survives without blood on his hand may be its ultimate triumph."
Best of Brazil,lukas-arg,25 November 2013,9,"The movie is just great! From the plot, the characters and the social context, everything is spotless. The story is well-defined. The director knows his stuff. One hand washes the other. Bart are you awake? YES! Take out the trash! Maradona Starts the left lane, and avoids an English ... But instead simply start your rabbit head Pepito! Hey how you doing'? good rate pa 'enjoy. The house is in order. Lets get it started. See you later alligators! On the bonus DVD, it is revealed that the only professional actor with years of filming experience was Matheus Nachtergaele, who played the supporting role of Carrot.[1] Most of the remaining cast were from real- life navels, and in some cases, even the real-life City of God Havel itself. According to Meirelles, amateur actors were used for two reasons: the lack of available professional black actors, and the desire for authenticity. Meirelles explained: ""Today I can open a casting call and have 500 black actors, but just ten years ago this possibility did not exist. In Brazil there were three or four young black actors and at the same time I felt that actors from the middle class could not make the film. I needed authenticity."" Beginning about 2000, about a hundred children and young people were hand-picked and placed into an ""actors' workshop"" for several months. In contrast to more traditional methods (e.g. studying theater and rehearsing), it focused on simulating authentic street war scenes, such as a hold-up, a scuffle, a shoot-out etc. A lot came from improvisation, as it was thought better to create an authentic, gritty atmosphere. This way, the inexperienced cast soon learned to move and act naturally."
This is a new crime masterpiece,halixog,19 January 2022,8,"Lil Ze and his gang have fun chasing a runaway chicken in a Rio favela called Cidade de Deus ""City of God"". Chicken comes to Rocket with a camera. Memories of the 60s of the last century tell the story of Rocket, who becomes a photographer for his friends. Lil Ze and his best friend Benny grow up to be the city's crime bosses. There is Carrot, who is a crime leader who is tolerant of Benny, and Knockout Ned, who has turned his back on crime."
Freaking Awesome,kdogg567,29 March 2003,10,"This movie makes almost every other movie I've seen for a long time seem pointless. So intense, so perfectly crafted, absolutely ubelievable. This is truly filmmaking at its very best. Every frame is necessary, and every frame is perfect. To just talk about it is not to do it justice. Go see it."
Poetry in motion (like a speeding bullet),niglees,29 March 2003,,"This is simply an incredible film. One of the best films I've seen in a long time. It's quick and has very diverse and unique characters. The shots in every scene is marvelous.  This film takes a depth into third world gang activities and some life style. It is just extraordinary, point blank. The story line and the other between stories are just captivating. The violence might turn some folks off but I definitely pull through it.  This is flick is definitely in my Top 5.              4 1/2 out of 5"
a great movie,mikeknight456,28 February 2014,9,"This movie is magic. If you watch it, it won't disappoint you. From beginning to end we watch as these kids grow up in the worst conditions this planet has to offer. Just as they found a way out, the world they live in refuses to let them leave and thus they become victims of the environment. Tragic!"
One of the most unique movies I have seen this decade.,michaeljonesy,4 February 2008,9,"City of God is a brilliant film in every sense of the word, perfectly constructed, with an effortless sense of style and a hard hitting sense of realism hammering home an important social message."
INTENSE MOVIE THAT WILL OPEN YOUR EYES,ntzanis,21 November 2002,10,I Saw This Movie At The 2002 Afi Fest In Hollywood California And I Must Say That I Had No Idea What To Expect From This Movie. I Knew Nothing Of It Before I Saw It. For American Movie audiences This Movie Mirrors Training Day In That You Have Movie Makers Walking Directly Into A War Zone In Order To Give The Viewer The Authentic Reality Of Whets Going On In These 2 Very Different Places. Although That's About Where The Similarities End. City Of God May Over Expose The Viewer To The Degree Of Violence That Inhibits The People Of These Towns. Especially The Role Of The Children As Victims And Protagonists. There Are Many Scenes That Seem To Freeze Time As You Watch Them. The Images Of Children Killing Other Children May Be To Honest For American Audiences. The Beauty Of This Film Is How It Is Able To Make You Feel Good While Never Allowing The Tension Of The What The Movie Is Really About To Escape Your Mind. It Takes An Open-Minded Person To Appreciate This Movie. Amorres Perros Came To Mind As I Watched City Of God. However What May Limit City Of God To The Level Of Amorres Perros Is That We Don't Ever Meet And Connect With Someone In These Town Is A Complete Victim. Someone Who Isn't Taking Part. However You Will Have To See The Movie To Judge For Yourself.....
Amazing,Elbundo,18 January 2009,,"This film is, in every way, one of the greatest achievements in modern cinema. Being one of my all time favorite films i think this film is beautiful and heart breaking at the same time. I have never been to the City of God, but i have been told it portrays it with such accuracy that it is hard to believe, this fact only adds to my love of this film. The unknown actors add to the story and portray their characters beautifully, with me not finding a single fault in the acting, directing, editing and producing. This film should be seen by every person who calls themselves a movie lover, missing it will only be missing out on a truly amazing film."
Contain my opinion about the movie.,b3mbboy,5 May 2005,8,"In Brazil in the 1960's there was a place called the City of God. In the movie the Trio robs motels and gas trucks for something to do and a quick way to make some cash. Younger kids watch them because they want to be apart of the Trio but the older kids wouldn't let them. Lil Ze went in and killed everybody in there thus getting his taste of the bad seed. In the 1970's, Lil Ze has grown up and took over his former comrades and now he owns the city. He causes violence and fear as he wipes out rival gangs without mercy. His best friend Bene is the only one to keep him on the good side of sanity. Rocket has grown up in the same settings but has taking a different route. His goal in life and dream is to take pictures and become a big photographer. He seems to always be in the wrong place at the wrong time though. Well in the 1980 there is still the continuing battle that is control and affecting the City of God. From my study in Latin American History, Brazil is the largest country in Latin America. It was one of the Portugal colonies sugar was one of the most important crops in the country. This country was declared independent from Portugal in 1822. ""Brazil's problems -- poverty, crime, environmental recklessness -- can seem larger than life, too. Although it is one of the industrial powerhouses of South America, Brazil has trouble feeding its entire people. And deforestation of the Amazon basin proceeds at an ominous rate. But in fits and starts, the country is taking on some of its seemingly insoluble problems. Most noticeably, improvement is being made in the dangerous crime situation in Rio."" This is the modern day report from a well know International travel agency about some of Brazil's problem's within the country. This movie in my opinion was rather accurate and ties in directly into the history of modern times in Brazil. It gives a real life visual to the actually life of some Brazilian natives. In contrast gives almost an unrealistic feeling about the whole city and everyday life of Brazil so with these to combine you get a distinct feeling of curiosity and wonder from the film. In my opinion if there would have been a brief introduction about the times in a narrative tone it would have help with the suspense of the movie? The movie was enjoyable to watch on the fact that the plot was good and the character where reliable and the quantity of scenes throughout the movie. Yes good for entertainment and great for education and addressee to the problems in Brazil. I rate this Movie 8 and half star on a (1-10) scale."
"Nice , Great",farhan-shahab43,6 May 2015,9,"Adapting the novel by Paulo Lins, who grew up in the Cidade De Deus fa vela and based the story on actual events and characters, screenwriter Braulio Mantovani has condensed the mammoth 600-page tome into key chapters, titles of which appear on screen, and split the action into three specific periods: the late 1960s, the 1970s and the early '80s."
"Summary: ""To be a real hood, you need more than just a gun, You need ideas""",Andy01,6 October 2003,10,"City of God is a violent (and true) account of the way of life in the Brazilian slums: unemployment, poverty, drugs, police corruption, and gangs of hoodlums. It concentrates on the 2 different paths chosen by two central characters, and the different lifestyles they lead to."
Hard to watch for all the right reasons,mark000,26 March 2003,,"This is a well-told and well-directed movie that I will go out on a limb and compare to some of Kubrick's films.  By the end, the message was so well-developed I had this vague impression that I had seen one of his better works.  The film is certainly harsh, as you would expect a film about gangs to be, but the harshness is integral to the story and cycle of violence which the movie is based on.  I highly recommend this to anyone who the topic interests.  For the Disney types, stay away."
this is the best film you will see this year,robcomber,18 January 2003,10,without doubt the best film of the year and the year has only started. sure go see lord of the rings and sit for the 3 hours with your ass going asleep but enjoy it. NO! Go see City of God and prepare yourself for an edge of seat experience. it keeps you going the whole way through. non-stop enjoyment. i loved it.
A must see movie,z-tomov,20 March 2017,9,"One of the best movie i have seen so far. Very emotional and the storytelling is amazing. I wish to see more projects like this on the big screen and not always the same, boring Hollywood marketing. Also no big names attached, yet great acting. I can say anything more besides that the movie shows very realistic what it means to live in poverty and all the struggle involved in it."
"Bloody Sensational, Painfully Fantastic",leonardorezende,26 January 2003,10,City of God is finally  playing here in New York. I wanted to see this movie to see what's everybody is raving about. And I too had to keep going back to the theater because it was always sold out. Watching city of God felt like entering a haunted house.   I wanted to close my eyes at some scenes but it was so good -- and engaging -- that I didn't. It's bloody sensational and painfully fantastic.
Rel mafiosos,cemoz,17 August 2003,10,"I think that Cidade de Deus is the new Godfather. Zé Pequeno is a blood-thirsty man this situation scares us because the things that we saw in that film happens in real world. I collect the crime films like Godfather, Goodfellas. Now Cidade de Deus is in my archive."
Intense!!!!,don_sol,28 April 2003,10,"WHOA!!! This movie is crazy...  It moves like a Brazilian dancer at Carnival!!!  It is fast-paced well sequenced...  The intensity of the movie will give you a heart attack...  You will feel your neck hairs curl up during the ""foot or hand"" scene...  This film is a realistic Quentin Tarantino style film on life in the projects in a third world country (now that is poor)...  This film should open the eyes of all that watch it..."

This movie it's gravely overhyped. There's absolutely no meaning to the storyline whatsoever."
One of the best film´s I ever seen,jorge-mealha,28 January 2004,10,"City of God is more than a violent Movie is the real story of the Rio de Janeiro way of life, the hard environment all the violence bring us to the reality of the favelas, Meirelles create a great work a master piece in cinema, very good young actors, this movie make all of us thinking in the real problems of the Brazilian society, it realy deserves the oscar for the best foreign movie and Fernando Meirelles may win the oscar for the best director ."
Masterful,Kman2025,31 May 2003,9,"Set in the slums of Brazil in the ""cidade de deus"" (city of god) this films delves deep into the realms of drug dealing and street crime with an intense realism that hollywood has never managed to produce. I have never seen a film so raw and brutal showing anything and everything that goes on in the streets."

One foreign film that you don't have to follow on words,silamban,5 August 2003,9,Truly incredible film. It shows the raw power that youngsters have ... and there is no gloss at all. Very raw and powerful.
A Brazilian masterpiece,hscabral,16 December 2003,10,"Even more than a hell of a great movie, City of God is also a ""sign"" to the brazilian producers. It's proved that we can produce good movies, with great direction of sound, music, photography, etc. Yes, it's violent, it's raw, but it's true. It's funny when you see others complaining about its content, since the Hollywood productions are SO much heavier... a good example? Gangs of New York. Do what I say, but don't do what I do."
"Recommending ""City of God"" to friends",donna-mcdowell,19 July 2005,9,"I just thought the movie was very good. It held my attention from beginning to end. I also enjoy movies that make me care about the characters and this one made me care about Rocket, Benny, Carrot and even Lil' Fe (I could not help but feel his pain at Benny's farewell party). I will recommend this movie to several friends who are so-called ""movie buffs"". If you are not a fan of subtitled movies, this is not for you. I feel that if this movie was watched dubbed, it would take away some of the powerful drama that it has. I did not give it a ten because I am not a fan of slow-mo, speed up type of filming, but even that did not take away from the grittiness of the film."
"An epic, involving gangster picture--superior to Goodfellas.",anonymuncle,22 February 2004,10,"That's right. This is a film of amazing depth and realism. Dramatic but not melodramatic, action-packed but not manipulative. Brilliant performances, sharp screenplay, gritty yet beautiful cinematography. I can't praise this one enough."
Best Movie,hunteshayann,10 November 2015,10,I can watch this movie non stop on going it is the best movie. it has entertainment and also a dark side to the movie. This movie gets a 100 and I can stop watching the movie. it was sad when his older brother died in the beginning of the movie. it is the Best movie ever. whoop. oh yeah.I don't usually watch movies but It is an amazing and there is nothing else i have to say about this movie because it was so good and he became a photographer and took care of his girlfriend and this should get a thousand hand up for the movie and the scenarios. amazing. the sexual soft core vs hard core was epic. little zee was my Favorite character in the beginning I said oh he is a very lonely guy and it surprised me when he turned out to be the bad gangster. but at the end the little children turned against him.
A must see,scottbslade,9 December 2015,9,"City of God is an exciting, action packed, and breath taking film. Large amounts of colors and thrilling camera angels are used to tell this tropical story. The film takes place in the slums of Rio De Janeiro, where the people party and police are long away. Director Fernando Meirelles does an awesome job of bringing the crime filled, poverty-stricken, gangland to life. The movie opens up with a group of young men on a wild chase after a chicken. This is when Rocket, the narrator, enters the film. The film flashes back to show Rocket's and his peers' crime filled childhood. Then a young child named Lil' Dice, later known as Lil' Ze, is introduced into the story. Lil'Ze's story will be told along side Rocket's. Rocket becomes a photographer when he receives a stolen Camera as a gift. From that point on, he builds a love with the art of photography. Rocket gets a small gig working with the newspaper in his city. His camera roll gets in the hands of another photographer and they use the pictures Rocket took of a terrifying gang leader. When the head gang leader, who happens to be Lil'Ze, sees he made the newspaper he becomes excited from the publicity. Rocket on the other hand, thinks it the end of his life, but actually gets recognition from both sides. The newspaper starts to pay him to continue with more pictures of the gangs. Rocket ends up scoring big when he gets some pictures of a death of a young gang member that was killed by a cop. Rocket becomes a professional photographer and makes it out of the ""City of God."" City of God is more than just an action and crime filled story. It is the tale of a young man making it out of a city where no one ever makes out. The contrast of Lil' Ze and Rockets lives are powerful among each other. It shows the reality of the slums of Rio De Janeiro. You either gang bang or hope you make it out with a talent. With the whole film being in Portuguese it gives it an authentic feel. Despite having to read the subtitles the film is easy to follow and stay connected to. The different culture amazes me but also shows it has a lot of similarity to the US crime movies. This is a great film and I highly suggest it. To me it's a classic must see gangster crime film."
what impressed me the most,Dreaded_Fist_of_the_Northeast,11 February 2004,,"is they had only a budget of $3.3 million.  even US independent films have an upwards of $10m or more in their purse.  this film showed alot of heart, from the wicked cuts to the overhead angles, it put you right in the thick of things.  it was gritty, it was intriguing, it was subtle yet straight to the point.  very powerful piece of filmmaking, and about the violence, I believe that the filmmakers showed it quite well.  they used their flashbacks really well, and I was overly impressed with the whole scheme of the movie."
City of God Critic,johnnywhite123456,9 June 2012,9,"I just saw this movie and I think that this is a great movie to watch, due to the rich amount of editing and composing skills that are shown on the movie. This movie creates great suspense with the use of editing; this makes the plot a whole lot interesting."

What a Masterpiece!,alegodinez69,14 June 2012,9,After recently watching the movie Ciudad de Dios I felt great pleasure. The story is very compelling to the audience. It focuses on a real story that shows the life in the favelas. This masterpiece is directed by Fernando Meirelles.
aok,gabjenei,4 June 2016,9,"Set in Brazil in the 1970s, the film tells the story of Rocket (Alexandre Rorigues in an excellent, understated performance), a teenage boy living in an extremely violent area of Rio De Janeiro called The City of God. Like most boys his age, all Rocket wants is to get laid, smoke a little blow and chill with his friends. However, the violence around him not only complicates this it throws him smack dab in the middle of it. When he loses his low paying job, he watches with envy the carefree life of the drug lords Lil Zee and Benny (Leandro Firmino and Phellipe Haagensen respectively) who run the ghetto. They flash money and ride brand new motor scooters through the streets of the hood. When he loses his girl to the more enigmatic gangster Benny, Rocket declares in frustration, ""It was like a message from God: Honesty doesn't pay, sucker."" Seeing delinquency as the only way to prosper, Rocket decides to pursue criminal ventures of his own. Fortunately, Rocket and his equally square buddy, prove to be the most inept of criminals. They don't even have the heart to rob a lost drunk who has unwittingly gotten lost in the slums. Rocket soon resigns himself to the fact he's no criminal. He's one of the nobodies. One of the thousands whose fate is in the hands of a few crazy fools with guns. Luckily for Rocket, fate was waiting around the corner with a better hand for him to play."
"Go watch how sin prevails in ""City of God""",ocapra_4,14 June 2012,8,"If you are looking for a different movie than what you are used to, and you are bored of Hollywood movies, ""City of God"" is the movie you should watch. It is a Brazilian movie released in 2002, directed by Fernando Meirelles. If you enjoy crime and drama films, the movie will capture you easily since the very beginning. ""City of God"" portrays Brazilian life in the slums where drugs and violence are always present. We might never have had imagined the violence and crime behind one joint of marijuana, but this movie exposes us to the rough path of getting involved with drugs and gangs."

City of God view from a film studies student **SPOILERS**,calvin1996,16 October 2017,10,"The City of God weaves about five different stories together into an on screen masterpiece. One would think that with that many separate plots the overall story would be lost or hard to understand but that is not the case with this film. The directors use parallel editing and flash backs to help tell the story of each individual character and how they fit into the bigger plot. This could be confusing but the directors use a narrator to help keep the stories straight. Even though this is a film with different stories no character is left undeveloped. Each story is told in the same environment of the other stories, with characters from different stories interacting with each other. This allows the audience to make a strong connection with each character, even if it's not their story. The film is also shot using a lot of close ups, this helps the audience with their connection as it puts them in the personal space of each character. The stories told however are not light stories, all involve the use of drugs, sex, and gang violence, with children taking part in all activates. The movie manages to desensitize the audience to these things though, as it wants to give a feel of what the characters have to live with every day. During some of the darker scenes the lighting is actually fairly bright and the music is upbeat, this assists with the desensitization. To help the audience feel more involved and apart of the story the film is shot with mainly a hand held camera, this physically puts them in the stories, and not as if just viewing it. Overall I would highly recommend this film to anyone, it keeps your interest the whole time, gives you a view into a life that is completely different then here, and by the end of the film you will realize how the cycle continues."
Excellent!!,spdss-spdss,7 September 2017,10,"It is a film that don't have the history of hero of 1000 faces. It explain the basic corruption on Brazil. I's a story of Tadim (Zé pequeno), a boy who grew up in the ""favela"" and who was forced to enter the world of crime early on. He killed several people, robbed, corrupted, etc. A brutal and impressive film that I highly recommend Great, great great..."
"In the heart of sunny Rio de Janeiro lies a dark world of poverty, violence, and the crumbled lives of young children.",donatasruzys,15 October 2016,10,"""If you raise a snake, expect to get bitten."" Unfortunately, those who raised Lil Dice never received his own words of wisdom. The 2002 film City of God, directed by Fernando Meirelles and Katia Lund, is anything but what the title might suggest. The viewer is taken on an unforgettable childhood journey that is narrated by Rocket, a young boy who grew up in Ciudad De Deus (City of God), one of the deadliest slums in all of Rio de Janeiro. From the very beginning, City of God is the type of film that captivates an audience with its unique visual style, letting the viewers know they are in for a true cinematic treat. In 2004 the film was nominated for four Academy awards, including Best Cinematography and Best Director. In spite of the severe hardship and the gut-wrenching violence, the cinematographic effects of the film leave the viewer glued to the screen, immersed with intrigue, and begging to hear more about the story of each character, who, at one point or another, fell prey to the evil world around them. The visual appeal of the film cannot be overemphasized. All aspects of editing, from lighting and camera angles, to moving camera shots and mechanical distortions of movement, are pieced together in the most brilliant and fascinating forms. Visual effects are not the sole appeal of the film, as the film takes the viewer on a nose dive into the life stories of several characters, allowing the viewer to understand the characters on a personal level and, in some cases, even form strong emotional attachments. In fact, many of the characters in the movie were recruited from the slums of Rio, including Alexandre Rodriques, who plays Rocket and had grown up in the actual City of God itself. In the City of God, the ""hoods"", or gangsters, are the role models for little kids playing in the streets. They are the ones the little kids look up to and grow up wishing to be. However, these hoods are nothing but kids themselves, young boys, who are given a gun at a young age and made to believe that poverty can be escaped through the short lived treasures of crime. As much as one would love to see Goose, Benny, or any of the other hoods put down their guns, it is important to remember that ""a hood doesn't stop, a hood takes a break."""
A help to open your eyes to reality...,vera_sabino,17 March 2007,10,"I do not love this movie because of the story that represents...and why? it's really frustrating to know in the present days that such violence, misery, exists in a way that makes you think, takes your sleep away, because this reality really exists, and I do not praise the misery but the fact that the filmmaker shows it in a way that you feel involved in the movie, the sadness, and what the people can do to one another just to survive. So I loved this movie because showed a reality that the most part of the people prefer to shut their eyes, than see it...so when you see this movie don't think you will see a bunch of people killing one each other, but a corruption and the killing of the mind and the respect of the human being living in such a condition, that no one, children, men, women should live...so when you see this movie, just think about it..."
A movie that DEMANDS your attention,ryanmlange-69119,17 October 2016,9,"This is a film that I have seen before but recently re-watched it again and really wasn't sure how the film would impact me the second time around, the film is quite shocking and hard to stomach at times the first time around so the second time the concern was there that it would lose a lot of its emotional impact. But only a few minutes into watching this film through its incredibly frantic editing, its almost hypnotizing cinematography and some of the most realistic performances i have ever seen, it was clear to me that this film would never ever quite lose the impact it so easily has on the viewer."
"""The displacement of impoverished black youth in the city of God and the changes incurred on a sociological level""",wafiqag,1 December 2016,9,"City of God is based on real events and figures; adapted from a largely biographical novel by Paulo Lins, the film uses mainly amateur actors, location shooting, and hand-held camera work to convey a sense of realism.

"An authentic, gritty and gripping film, encapsulating the real life problems faced with living in the slums",rick_maskell92,3 June 2014,9,"City of God is based on the novel by Paulo Lins, which follows Rocket and his friends growing up in one of Brazil's most notorious slums. A hippie at heart, Rocket (played by Alexandre Rodrigues) made it his destiny to stay on the right side of the law and become a photographer, which would prove tough in a place where crime seemed the only option."
"""In the hand, or the foot?""",Bwheels,27 February 2007,9,"""In the hand, or the foot"", the chilling choice offered up to the smallest of children by Li'l Ze, the toughest hood ever to rule over the City of God. As the children cry and the gangsters laugh we are shown a world so far removed from our own that we find it difficult to even comprehend the lives that face these characters. This is the moment when we realise that these characters are not figments of some writers imagination, but they are representing the conditions that hundreds of thousands of people face each day of their lives. It is this quality that contributes to the powerful message delivered by Meirelles' ""City of God""."
WOW - Great Movie,montanagirl,7 December 2005,10,This movie is riveting. It is impossible to turn your head away from the screen for a moment. What an incredible story. An honest and gut-wrenching look at the drug underground in Rio de Janero in the 1960s and 1970s.
What an amazing display of acting and directing talent,frankiec996,22 April 2006,10,"Out of all of the movies that I have seen (yes i have seen a lot), this is one of my favorites. The good acting and the good camera shots and genius directing make this movie a top 50 movie."
This is reason there are movies,BryceVR,29 May 2011,9,"When we get past the entertainment there is a hook in the soul that a true film portrays. It is a movie. It is a docudrama It is a long painful look at ourselves. The pleasure and gratification against the squalor and despair of the environment. The Juxtaposition of the protagonists and their inevitable showdown gives us extraordinary drama within the reality of the Sao Paulo ghetto. There are very few movies, books or plays than can hope to get here, Schindlers list, Shawshank redemption and Paths of Glory are a few that spring to mind as naked comments on the primal nature of man. This movie moves the primal nature into your face and keeps it there, unrelentingly. A must see movie in any definition."

Just because you need to read the subtiles does not mean that you need to be a film snob to see and enjoy it. It will make you think and you can not stop watching it."
not as good as many say,snowgoddessq,13 August 2003,,"I am always surprised at how much extreme violence in a movie can take the place of good dialogue and character development.  Granted, I did just read the subtitles, so maybe the original text was better.  But aside from that, I thought that City of God was a horrible waste of my time.  It is good that movies like that are made, but I do not think they should be seen as the only type of movie to see and thus the best.  I saw no real point to the story other than how terrible the life on the streets in Brazil is and how wonderful it was that the narrator survived it.  Some of the scenes made me sick and if that's what it takes to be a good film these days, then I'd rather watch the usual rubbish that comes out these days."
Rio de Janeiro in a new light,CSauc,15 October 2017,7,***SPOILER ALERT***
Sarah Simar—City of God,alicat-86171,16 October 2017,,"Guns, gangs, crime, drugs, power, wealth, survival—these are the most obvious themes in the City of God. There is no way out, no safe place to hide in the City of God. If you are not in a gang, you are forced into one at a very young age. One of the main characters and narrator of the story, Rocket, dreams of being a photographer and getting out of this violent world. The other one, Ze Pequeno, wants to rule the city from a young age with his partner Benny and accomplishes just that through a series of malicious acts. These two characters are so radically different but their paths cross more than once throughout the movie. These moments reiterate the theme that there is no way out, even for Rocket, who wants nothing to do with any gang."
City of God,johnmbradley,16 October 2017,9,"The City of God takes you to a place about as far from the idea of heaven that we are given as the years have gone on. In this film we are able to see how our narrator Rocket and a boy the same age as him named Lil Ze do with the lives they have been given in lawless city. This film gives a great insight into the dangers of living in this dangerous neighborhood of Rio de Janeiro and how just where you live and are brought up can affect your life in so many ways. It also shows to us how people can judge you by where you live and made snap decisions about you when they learn where you are from. Time and time again in this film we are shown how characters can are expected to be part of a gang because of where they live and how they cannot keep certain jibs because the owners learn where they are from. We are also shown the different possibilities someone faces when you grow up in a bad neighborhood. Do you stay and rule the neighborhood, try to get out and die, get out then get brought back, or be that lucky few who gets out and has a future. Overall I felt like this was an outstanding film and gave a great look at the struggles of growing up in a bad neighborhood and feel anyone should watch it to give themselves something to reflect on that may never occurred to them before."
"A timely piece on gun violence and children, but still missing some pieces.",geraldplangosch,16 October 2017,7,"Violence on children is something that has been strayed away from in film due to fear of being taboo. In City of God, the true story of gang wars that take place in a small city in Rio during the 1960s and 1970s, violence against (and typically stemming from) children is anything but taboo, and so it is that the children define the film. Their interactions both business-like and genuine, and with little remorse from any of the involved."
Amazing film,kleto,16 October 2017,9,"The City of God directed by Fernando Mierrelles is an intense spectacle of the brutal life inside Brazils notorious favelas. Two boys with completely different ways of life put on a show from theft, murder, to drugs to the complete opposite side of the spectrum which is photography. The film was a beautiful peace of art, utilizing everything from lighting changes, camera angles, and close-ups to see and really feel the intensity of a scene. These all also help portray the poverty and hardships that those in the favelas must face. Blood, dirt, and garbage couldn't seem to leave the streets of Rio De Janeiro. Acting in the film was good but could have been better. At times, the actors almost seemed uncomfortable in certain parts of the movie like in death scenes. The movie was a very intense movie that kept me very interested from the very start to the end. The way the director told the story was the best part, in my opinion. The director would tell a single characters story one at a time and did it in chronological order until the director got to the end of the story, which is also the beginning of the film. Despite the acting not being the greatest, the film was actually magnificent and I would highly recommend this movie to everyone being that it is base off a true story and gives the viewer a better perspective on life and their position."
Movie Review,kywi-45612,16 October 2017,10,WARNING: SPOLER ALERT!
"City of God is a film that takes place in the favelas of Brazil. It is a crime drama that revolves around guns, love, sex and drugs.",samuelrgarcia,16 October 2017,9,"Brazil, the beautiful country located South America has many documentaries displaying its beauty. The City of God has an establishing shot where we see the chaos that is in the favelas of Brazil. The sound editing of the film was superb. There are moments in the film where you completely do not notice the sound editing, but there are scenes where you look back on and realize how genius the sound editing was. Good sound editing is forgotten about because it was either not terrible but not great. Great sound editing is noticed. City of God plays with mundane sounds and makes us feel them. Gun shots are expected in a gangster movie, but City of God creates a symphony with the gun shots. Some shots are louder than others, some gun shots also resonate longer. There is also a melodic tempo in which the gangs shoot their guns. The mise-en-scene in the film is also simple, but powerful. We look into the homes of many of the characters. Most of the characters live in poverty, we see this reflected in their homes. Although the characters do not have much, we can tell a story alone based on the items they wear and the objects that that they have. City of God is a great film that recommend everyone should watch. The sound editing plays along with the great dialog and the mise-en-scene is simple, but effective. City of God opens your eyes to the beauty and travesty of living in some parts of Brazil"
What a Film,jcheese-86933,16 October 2017,9,"The characters in this movie were what made this piece so special. It almost felt like we had to choose what side we were fighting with, Knockout Ned or the infamous Li'l Ze. The movie begins by explaining the ""City of God"" a small scummy place in the middle of Rio DE Janeiro, Brazil. Drug dealers run the streets and kids kill other kids just for fun. Li'l Ze begins his life by joining the older kids with petty crimes but escalates to mass murder within a few minutes. He grows up to be one of the most feared and ruthless drug dealers in the ""City of God."" Knockout Ned, with the help of Carrot, led the other drug gang in the city. Li'l Ze kills Ned's family and destroys his family home. This is when the war begins. The film pushes us to join Ned's force because he wants justice, all he wants is revenge for his families' death. We follow every move up until his death. This is the scene that got me the most. We see the most caring person, even in the middle of battle field, try to help a wounded child. The moment Knockout Ned turns around the child shoots him in the back. This scenes amazing because it showed me everyone was in this war for some personal reason. The reason the kid was in the war, to get revenge for his father's death. Who killed his father you ask? Knock Out Ned. Nobody cared about the cause of the war, but the war gave them a cause to fight and kill those who did them wrong."
City of God ***SPOILER ALERT***,poulettegarcia,16 October 2017,10,****SPOILER ALERT****
City of God,christopherjkoelle,18 October 2017,8,"City of God (2002) directed by Fernando Meirelles and Katia Lund paints an entirely different picture of life in Rio than the welcoming Cristo Redentor may exude. The film explores the dangerous, yet sadly mundane life that the youth live in the slum that the poor live in called the City of God. Rocket, a young photographer trying to separate himself from the violence, narrates the story and captures the daily life of the city through his lens."
City of God Spoilers!!!!,tartedav,18 October 2017,,"With the name city of god, you would expect a more upbeat movie that is based around religion. Instead the movie depicts the horrors of organized crime in the suburb of Rio de Janeiro in the 1970s. As the movie continues you to begin to see a pattern occur for many of the people that live in this area. As characters are raised in these in violet areas they eventually become violent themselves. It becomes a viscous cycle of a constant struggle of power for each generation since they see the power and money that could be obtained if they go into organized crime. This is seen in the ending where the character ""Lil Zé is murdered by his own gang members since he lost some of his power and showed the children who murdered him how to obtain power in organized crime. This ending particularly shows that the city is never going to fix itself. It will have another generation that will become more violent and strive for power like the beginnings of Lil Zé career. This gives the characters in the city of god to run away from the city or to commit crimes."
Great performance,benhalljr,26 January 2018,,"Stand out performances,brilliant script, great direction, the story is very good, and I could not stop watching.."
Many consider a movie outstanding just because it shows tragic poverty and violence,lecirquestudio,6 February 2018,9,"Many consider a movie outstanding just because it shows tragic poverty and violence. Subconsciously, people feel ""politically correct"" for liking it. Praise becomes a form of self- elevation, whilst the mere, unnecessary styling offends the topic's intrinsic seriousness. The ideological showcase overcomes an honest presentation. Mixing tragic elements to create a shocking, poignant movie is easy. But somehow the whole thing becomes a farce too pretentious to be positively assessed. An unpunished, 10 year old killer runs around, kills everyone and then bursts into evil laughs. The horrifying situation exists in reality. But a film approach ought to be different. This film has been sold as a kind of triumph of the human spirit, yet it's no more than a typical mobster movie sited at Jacarepaguá. Scene after scene, someone is killed and the deaths have the same depth or significance of a video game. The protagonist does nothing to improve himself. He is a social victim, period. He features the moral character of a robot. And banditry, to the Brazilians' 'delight,' recruits untouchable children as hoods. A Guy Ritchie-like gang plot has its moments of shock: non stop bloodbaths & revolting human filth. For those fond of Grand Guignol, this is a perfect movie. Horrible and cheap in all aspects, including pain and suffering. Simply pathetic, filmed as an elegant commercial edited with rather annoying camera movements. City of God was just another product from the Third World that dazzled the radical chic community of the First World."
City of Epic film!,narshsmith,30 July 2021,10,"Great film from begin to end! From Police chases , relatable characters and beautiful back drop of Brazil, presents a thrilling story told in the ghetto."
Actually very nice movie,martyboyum,23 May 2018,10,"Oh .oh . it,s really good movie forever . watch too many time ."
"original Gangster film, but gets boring.",bporter-porter3,20 September 2013,6,"The film begins in the 60's and when you're watching this part, you have high hopes for the rest of the film, as it shows a lot of promise, however don't get your hopes up. Little Ze's killing spree's in the 70's and 80's become over the top, and the amount of deaths are ridiculous. However the cliffhanger ending where the kids talk about their own killing spree , leaves a nice, but horrific cliff hanger ending. It is very different to most gangster films as it contains some type of background story as it's based on a true story. The story of Rocket is also very endearing, as throughout the film you find yourself willing him to do well in his photography, so this for me makes up for the over the top violence ,so brings the film up from a 5, to a 6 out of10.One to watch if you're into international cinema or/and violent films."

Styalized brilliance in a thrilling and gripping journey. Ditch the Hollywood formula. YOU WILL NOT LEAVE YOUR SEAT,zachwilliams,13 June 2005,10,"I am an avid user of IMDb. When I see a good film I will give it a good vote. When I see an excellent film I may just give it a ten. ""City of God"" is unlike anything I have ever seen. This film takes the boundaries of excellence and destroys them--it is the only film that has inspired me to compose a comment. Take brilliant directing, a captivating story and excellent cinematography, and you will get ""City of God""."
The City of God: Eye Opener,daynakalvaro,14 October 2018,10,SPOILER ALERT!
A Thrilling Ride (Contains Possible Spoilers),ryanward-78234,14 October 2018,9,"City of God is unlike many foreign movies you will see. From start to finish, this movie will keep you on the edge of your seat. The movie starts off with a fun game of soccer between young kids, with the main character introducing himself to the audience. Very shortly after, you learn the stories and the lives of those close to him and the violence that entangles each and every person living in their small town. While the film jumps from character to character, the movie revolves around Rocket, who is trying to find his place growing up in the slums.
Each important character is introduced by either slow motion or a freeze frame of them on screen and then an introduction by Rocket to the audience explaining who they are and then followed up by their story and how they are relevant to Rocket. This use of editing, while it may seem outdated and tacky, is really helpful for the audience to get an idea of who each person is in this story and to give a good amount of information about each character. This simple editing is really key to the story because it symbolizes Rockets future career and aspirations as a future photographer. The still frames of the characters with Rocket explaining who they are is just like if someone were to hold up a picture of that person and Rocket would explain their purpose to him.
This movie is a must see for anyone that is in need of seeing a fantastic foreign film. While there is heavy violence, it helps capture the life these characters had and how their life changes so much throughout the film. It will keep you watching and wanting to know more from start to finish."
Fantastic - *Potential Spoilers*,erinlong-78407,14 October 2018,9,"This film opens in a unique fashion, by cutting from different actions that are occurring around the city. While the opening to the film seems somewhat overwhelming at first, we learn that it is truly vital to throughout the film. The opening is thrilling and definitely sets the tone for the remainder of the film. We are introduced to our main character and narrator, Rocket, very early on in the opening. Rocket comes off as a quite relatable character, as it easily seen that he does not quite fit in with what is going on around him, in both his friend groups and within the city he lives."
Environment Effects way of life,annelapunkal,14 October 2018,8,"City of God was an interesting film that showed how the root of violence can stem from one's environment. The choices that were made by each individual in the movie either led to their death, downfall, or success. Lil Dice, on the other hand, was the exception; on the statistical side of the spectrum. He was a part of a robbery in the beginning of the movie and from that moment he chooses his path. He killed innocent people just for the fun of it, inferring that from the smile and laughter he got from the crime. There were many low angle shots of Lil Dice shooting at the ground, aiming at someone. With each shot, he got older. The angle of the shot and the gun in his hand made him appear powerful in the audience's eyes. As time passed, he became more powerful. The last shot from that scene also showed Benny with him, shooting at the sky while Lil dice was shooting at someone.This last shot gave foreshadowed hope for Benny. Although they shared an environment, Benny fell in love and was trying to change his life. He attempts to leave the life of crime. The scene at the dance was ominous. From the zoom in on the kid with the gun, the loud music, the lighting, and the pan shot of Lil Dice moving towards Rocket suggest that this scene was going to be important. If I had to take something away from this film, it would be that life is all about choices and sometimes it is out of your control. The environment that you are brought up in effects your life tremendously. The people around you influence your decisions and it can teach or even kill you in the end."
City of God: Nature vs. Nurture,megob-23058,14 October 2018,9,"The term City of God refers to the unity of the Holy Roman Empire and the Roman Catholic Church. In the case of the 2002 film City of God, however, it tells the story of a neighborhood divided. The narrative of the film is unique because while it is told from the perspective of Rocket it is still able to tell the stories of several other residents of the City of God. This element is crucial as the movie would not have worked if you did not understand each of these characters and who they have become as a result of their environment."
That's not really the truth,tetrical,25 July 2005,8,"For sure it is a great movie but a very factional movie! Living in Brazil isn't exactly like that... It is a country almost large as US, and it has deep differences between one state and another."
Must See! Cinematic work of art with a great story,mikeprzzl,15 October 2018,8,"The City of God goes above and beyond when it comes to informing the world as to what really goes on in the slums; in this particular case, in Brazil. After viewing the film, I quickly learned that people got dragged into a particular lifestyle based on who they surrounded themselves with. People either chose to get educated and get a job, or they became gangsters and robbed. The main character, ""Rocket"", happens to fall somewhere in between. The directors use a unique story-telling method and a variety of special effects to put together this cinematic work of art. Right off the bat, we are given a flash-forward to one of the ending scenes following a hand-held camera running after a chicken. This instantly sets the tone and lets the audience know that they are in for an action packed movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat. As a part of this flash forward, the directors use ""Matrix-Like"" bullet time to give us a unique perspective as to what kind of situation Rocket is in. Furthermore, the film uses a variety of montages to compress as much info as possible, whether we are learning about a drug operation or the development of a certain character; the use of these montages is an extremely effective method of catching the audience up with what is going on. To initiate and conclude a character's personal narrative, the narrator would directly mention that we were observing someone new. These personal narratives were often concluded with a murder of some sort working in sync with fade outs (almost always indicating changes in plot without direct narration). Overall, I was very impressed with the film's story and cinematic elements. The suspense consistently had me wondering what will happen next and when looking at the production as a whole, it was hard to believe the film was over 15 years old. I would highly recommend it to anyone of age."
Real on a Historical Level,lazers-91939,15 October 2018,7,"The City of God may be an ironic title for the movie. The film is set in a slum of Rio and focuses on the story of a group of kids who grew up to be adults still living the slum. The set of the film truly encompasses the looks and appearances of how slum and the people in the slum would appear in real life, which helps add to the fact that the film is based on a true story. This also adds to the realness of the film itself. The development of each character really helps create the plot and each character builds off of each other, which makes the film enthralling. Each character keeps the audience on the edge of their seats wondering what will happen next; and the film is set for all audiences. The casting of each actor was very methodical, as all of the actors seemed to fit directly into their roles and assume the personalities and feelings of each person's lives. However, I definitely believe they may have type casted the actor who played Angelica because she appeared to have very basic skills in acting. Besides her, the rest of the actors allow you to connect directly with their characters and understand them as human beings. The film creators even play the historical interviews after the credits to supplement the information given throughout the movie. The director even lined up one the interviews of a person with their character in the movie almost exactly, which also contributed to the realness of the movie."
An Underrated Gem,richardmachaj,15 October 2018,10,"City of God Review
This movie had me on the edge of my seat even after I learned that it was in a foreign language. The City of God puts you right in the action of all the gang violence and the director does an incredible job with the editing and lighting such as in the scene where Benny is killed. Cidade de Deus disorients the audience in this scene just like how the characters were with many close up shots and blinding lights. The last thing that I expected was for Benny to get killed because he was one of the only major characters that wanted to get away from all the violence. To add to his unexpected death, his killer was a man that loved Benny, and this death scene speaks to the chaotic lifestyle in the Brazilian favelas that keep you guessing."
City of God or City of Evil?,roberttalarico,15 October 2018,7,"The City of a God is a very ironic name for this movie as well as the city that the film takes place in. When people think of God they picture happiness and well being. In this film however, the City of God is full of thieves and murderers. This movie tells the story of how a group of children grow up with very little parental guidance and gives you a chance to see some of their challenges when they are younger as well as when they are older. The down goes down hill through out the movie and you get the chance to see a boy and his dream to become a photographer come in to play as he uses the power of his photographs to create his own affect on the situation.
Personally, I really enjoyed the movie. It was full of action and kept you on your toes multiple times in anticipation for what was to come. What really drew me to this film was that circumstances similar to these have happened around the world through history and for someone looking from the outside in, it really gives you a sense of how lucky you really are.
As far as the quality of the film goes, it was many action shots showing the perspective of many different characters. The lighting also brought a lot of character to the movie as well, because a lot of the dirty work was done at night time behind the safely of darkness. I believe the makers of this film did a very good job at depicting many of the details of this movie. From the movement of drugs and movie, to the handling of guns and the brittleness of life, they directors captured all of it very well to the point that you could feel what the characters were feeling
 Overall I felt that this was a very well directed movie with a lot of very well captured moments. I would definitely recommend this movie to someone who interested in historical and action filled movies."
Nonstop action in City of God - (SPOILERS),dominiqueporus,15 October 2018,8,"Based on the notorious slums of Rio de Janeiro, City of God is an ironic film (due to the title and narrative) depicting the many struggles of violence that the kids have to live through day in and day out. The film goes through a full circle, scenes being shown back and forth between the past and future years. The persistent use of flashbacks certainly catch the viewers' attention in an extremely dynamic way. The main character, Rocket, narrates as himself experiencing the constant violence and vulgarity that is represented so meticulously. Rocket and his friends do not have a typical upbringing as most children - instead, they are consistently surrounded by vicious criminals who take pleasure in raping and murdering their victims. Lil' Dice and other hoodlums represent how the society views men in the film. Power is essential to these appalling individuals, and it is clear that they will do whatever they need to obtain the highest amount of control over the weaklings in the city. Despite the struggles of his upbringing in the City Of God, Rocket wants to be successful and make something out of his substandard life. His passion for photography is very well demonstrated throughout the film. The characterization of not only Rocket and his peers, but the criminals in the film as well, undoubtedly keeps the viewers on their toes constantly. The action is so relentless that it can be difficult to keep one's eyes away from the screen for even a moment. Being based in the 1960's, it is only fair to say that the editing of City Of God is subpar, however this is what makes the film so very compelling and it would not be as engaging if it was presented in a different way."
An Enthralling Narrative of Beautiful Cinematography and Sharp Social Commentary,zakiyacowan,15 October 2018,10,"Fernando Meirelles' and Katia Lund's 2002 film, City of God, is a vortex that swallows the audience into its cyclic narrative that emphasizes the dangers of toxic masculinity and consequences of the notion ""being a man."" As observed in the film, a twisted perspective of manhood can be a bullet that passes through one generation to the next, destined to extinguish them all. 
 Throughout City of God, there is a theme of possession and an obsession with power, even at the expense of others. Young boys in the film admire their elders and develop a seething hunger to be ""hood"" and join this world of deceit, danger, and money; resulting in the tragic downfall of some young men as they endure this conquest to manhood and success. Along the way, women are slain, stripped of their bodily agency, and objectified, left at the disposal of men. Simultaneously, drugs and drug spots are overtaken in an endless battle to be ""top dog."" City of God manifests itself into a condemnation of conditioning young men to think that in order to ""be a man,"" they have to achieve that title by all means necessary. City of God is a violent, brutal attestation to the detrimental aftermath that ensues when boys live in society where drugs, money, and power equate to the value of one's self-image. 
 Meirielles' film is a stunning execution of a labyrinth-like storyline in which the audience delves into the lives of multiple characters. Then, through cinematic moves such as foreshadowing and flashbacks, seamlessly intertwines these plots that become a metaphorical domino effect. As the film progresses, and gradually strips down the plot, we observe how the actions of one character causes a steady disruption in the lives of everyone else. From the jarring, handheld camera scenes, to the drastic shifts in color gradients from deep, saturated blues, to honeyed yellows, the audience experiences the chaotic and disruptive life of the film's gang members. Similarly, to the characters in the story, the audience is overtaken by this whirlpool narrative, trapped in ""the slum that had been a purgatory."" But, ""now it's hell."""
Brutal but Important Story,madelinemschaal,16 October 2018,8,"City of God is a heartbreaking yet eye-opening look at how children grow up quickly or, unfortunately, not at all in the slums of Brazil. At many points during the film it is comparable to seeing the violent coverage on television news programs about happens daily in the city of Chicago. 
I found it hard to watch this film at many points because of the sheer brutality because it involved younger children. I feel that as a nation we are often desensitized to violence due to various video games, television shows, movies, and real life. However, it is a different story when the violence revolves around younger children. 
An important aspect of the story that I found moving was the fact that this film is based off of true events. The main character, Alexandre Rodrigues, actually lived in the location where the film takes place. 
One issue I have with the film is the fact that I found it difficult to focus on the movie and the characters while also needing to pay close attention to the subtitles. This film requires your full attention at all times. While it is obvious that this is a minor problem, it is still important to take into account before watching. 
One aspect of the film that I enjoyed was the sequence of scenes where we learned how the small apartment had been used by the different gang leaders and how it had changed hands over time. 
The audience is encouraged to root for Rocket as he tries to escape his dangerous slum. City of God is an important and raw re-telling of Rocket's experiences growing up and his journey to escape the seemingly unavoidable fate of those of live among him."
Beautifully made,oparamo-99783,17 October 2018,10,"The film City Of God is a heart string pulling film full of hate, violence, love and sadness. This film touches upon struggles that low income cities encounter in other countries. It heavily displays the affects of crime and drug trafficking to those involved and bystanders. Such struggles can push any child or adult into a life that they later recognize they do not want or into a life where they end up dying. The film introduced us to certain characters and informs the audience that it is based on true events, in a way to form a connection, with that connection the audience felt hurt and/or mad when the characters did."
Why?,dudestevie,6 May 2004,,Powerful. Exciting. A fantastic storyline. Impressive dialogue.
A raw reality of the brazilian suburbs,reano,18 September 2002,10,"Everybody should see this movie. It shows the ""favela"" reality in a way never explored before. And also give us a feeling of guilt, a throat-closing feeling every time you see a 6-year-old child handing a gun."
Great! Better them Traffic,JohnConstantine,13 October 2002,10,"Great movie! Perfect picture of life in slums ruled buy drug dealers. This movie was made with real people from this neighborhood including the main characters. It's very violent but also very truthful. Action, violence and reality as expected a little humor sometimes. It's great! Better them Traffic."
Raw. Moving. Real.,VIPER22,10 February 2004,10,"I can't say that I loved the movie, but I know when I've seen a very good and powerful movie."
God and His City,guto_ribeiro,8 September 2002,10,"Who supports the Brazilian traffic? Who supports 'Zé Galinha'? As the journalist in this movie, people who adore to talk bad about the police and the thieves. Hypocrites that adore to light a joint to relax and only think about himself. I know that this side does not only exist, that the traffic has much more webs around it, and we cannot cannot forget how that is very important."
gangster,kbueschenfeld,16 April 2006,10,"this movie is not only a normal cinema movie in my opinion. it is the passion of cinema.the movies has the lowest budget you can have ,and the actors are laien from the city of god. but they aren't perfect in there playing like tom hanks in road to perdition or Edward Norton in American history x .but cause of this normal negative aspect the film is already great ,then the characters show the life in the slums between drugs ,violence and maltreatment . sometimes the film is wonderful in his action and dialogs ,but then a moment later it is like punch when a character dies. i think cicade de deus is a brilliant movie and the best ever made in this time."
AMAZING!!,agerbergju,15 September 2020,9,This movie is absolutely amazing. A classic everyone has to watch.
Absolutely Brilliant,kingjamz,21 August 2006,10,"Cidade de Deus was amazing. I usually don't enjoy reading subtitles all the way through a film, but after the first 2 minutes, i was so drawn in i forgot they were there. The actors are brilliant considering they are all relative unknowns, well in Britain and the US anyway. The film takes a look at the underworld of brazil's largest city, Rio De Janero and what is discovered will shock as much as it will entertain you. A city that is rife with crime, from seasoned gangsters to 10 year old boys, everyone is killing, stealing and dealing their way through life in order to survive in the city of god. If you haven't seen this film, watch it as soon as."
The jaggedness of horror with real-life emotions,amgeographer,10 July 2020,8,"As a fellow film enthusiast, city of god has been a mind boggling experience for me that i ever I've had with Brazilian cinemas. Sadness, anxiety and tragedy are recognized, but not the kind of usual outrage that we see in true-to-life American films about con crimes."
Piece of history,ee95104,29 August 2003,9,"Not only an excelent film, this film is a wonderful documentary of the last 30 years of brasilian urban life. More specific of the poor neighbourhoods, known as ""favela"". ""Cidade de Deus"" is such a ""favela"", created by the government to create housing without satisfying other basic needs. More than a documentary, this film is action packed. Gangsters, drug dealers, corrupt policeman, well, what more could you want? There are car chases, gunfight, pretty much of everything. Just to topple that, there is a multitude of sub plots, that bring us back and forth in time, and immerse the viewers in the history of this ""favela"". One feels part of it, and acquainted to all the characters, as they develop through the film. Amazingly enough, or maybe not, it is based on true stories... That can explain the extreme realistic feel we get throughout the film, one can hardly imagine we are looking at actors..."
Capturing,inspocean-82059,28 August 2022,10,"Outstanding story telling. A tale of growing up a youngster. At the heart of brutality fueled by poverty. The concept of growing up too fast gets a new perspective here. The audience is thrown from the start into the flames of an escalating violence. A no mans land with absent fathers and mother too busy too care. You probably have already heard about street children, here you will live their life. Hardly any one been able to recapture the pain of lost childhood so intensely. You do not get a second chance, so your first mistake could be your lost one. Loyalty does not pay the usual way. A piece truly able to keep you on the chair through the whole movie."
My first film from Brazil.,jackshow-34413,5 August 2020,10,"Brazilians know how to make a good movie or is just this one? I really really liked it and everything looked so real. I later read that everything is ""real"" - they shot it there in the favelas. Crazy."
Brazilian Filmmaking at its Finest,thomaschaidez,11 October 2020,9,"The name City of God is ironic, because there seems to be no god present here. Fernando Meirelles does a great job giving an extremely convincing depiction of how cut throat and desperate life can be in the poverty stricken favela, and that is down to filming location, and the authentic performances giving by the actors, many of whom were not professional and actually lived in City of God, if not nearby favelas."
"An experience you will not forget, nor regret.",lorenzojferro,8 October 2020,8,"If you have a pacemaker, make sure to turn it up a beat and prepare yourself for The City of God. This movie chucks a lot at you in the opening sequences where your eyes are bolting around like a chicken without its head. This movie does not expect you to swallow everything about it and instead forces you to take it as a whole-body experience."
City of God,jessehoffmeyer,12 October 2020,9,"People enjoy a coming-of-age story. Seeing someone struggle through hardship and come out stronger and more prepared in the end. But in the City of God, coming-of-age starts with you holding your first gun, and ends with you on the streets; cold and stiff. People enjoy a war story. Falling in love with characters fighting through hell to come back to the safety of home and reunite with loved ones. But in the City of God, there is no safety to return to, and no family left to protect.
City of God seamlessly blends a coming-of-age tale in the midst of violent gang warfare in the slums, called favelas, of Rio de Janeiro. At parts, the film cuts fast and deep, weaving back and forth through time and matching the energy of the coke and rage fueled action on screen. A smart decision, even if the pace early on may leave some confused. Other parts are more methodical, a calm before the storm as characters enjoy the normal life of being with friends, flirting with girls, and snorting coke. Sound helps mediate this difference with upbeat tracks that emphasize the safety of good moments, to the long and tense periods of silence. There is a notable lack of music in tense sequences which expands the suspense beyond any other instrumentals found in the same spots as other films.
What is truly special about the film are the actors, or lack thereof as many were cast from the surrounding favelas. These non-professional actors not only highlight themselves, but the city that has given them this live fast or die hard nature. Even though filming was done decades after the events that take place, favelas are still a prominent and dangerous locations in Rio. More or less making the kids shown in the film the same as those they are portraying, having been born and bred in deep seeded poverty. These kids may find themselves one day in the roles they were cast in, condemned to die for the same reasons they died on screen; because war, war never changes."
City of God - The Endless Cycle,pauljbuldak,12 October 2020,9,"Fernando Meirelles and Katia Lund's City of God is a terrific film about living in the slums and the cycle of violence that accompanies it. Many continue to be stuck in the cycle of drugs and violence, while some try to free themselves from it to make a better life. Meirelles and Lund employ fast-paced action right from the beginning. When it starts out, you are left with a lot more questions than answers. After a few scenes, you start adjusting to the quick pace and you start getting your answers. You become invested in the characters that you couldn't keep up with at the beginning. Throughout City of God, you follow Rocket, who also narrates the film, in his attempt to make it out of the seemingly endless cycle."
City of god is nothing you will never forget,kaylynngillespie,12 October 2020,7,"City of god has everything From the fear of the inevitable to the seemingly unending violence in the film. This movie started with narration, setting up the film for what the unexpected brings: we can hear diegetic sounds of running and guns smacking tables. Meirelles does not prepare his audience for the cyclic violence and unending tragedy within the film.Meirelles attempts to make his audience uncomfortable. This film does an excellent job of highlighting the extreme poverty within Brazil with the diegetic sounds of traffic and clashing knives used to represent violence. The music in the film does an exceptional job of sweeping the audience away and plunging them into the main character (Rocket) world also it plays a large role in this film as it is set in the 60s, 70s, and 80s. When watching films normality subtitles can be distracting but with this film the subtitles pull you into the film even more and emphasizes the film by understanding every word that is said.The film's cinematography and editing are outstanding. Even though it starts out really chaotic, you get used to it and it just shows what happens in extreme poverty within Brazil.the slums and the cycle of violence with in the film is hard to watch but it is needed in this film for so many reason because it shows realism about what is happening to others. Many continue to be stuck in the cycle of drugs and violence, while some try to free themselves from it to make a better life for themself some will never be able to. Really good films recommend watching."
City of God,ryansporter,12 October 2020,7,"City of God, directed by Fernando Meirelles, shows the audience the violence and hardships that are faced in the slums of Rio de Janeiro. Meirelles is able to capture the selfishness and greed that thrives in the slums through the eyes of Rocket- the main character that knows the ins and outs of these horrific lifestyles that exist in the City of God. This movie was extremely fast paced, as all of the characters moved swiftly to their destinations. What also helped this fast-paced lifestyle was the music that was played throughout the movie. The music built this suspense that made the audience eager to what would happen next. Through the uses of many different shots including crane, zoom and handheld that if you want to be able to survive in the slum, you have to keep up. Throughout the film we would be following Rocket and his journey through flashbacks and learn more about each character that would pop up with him. I really believe that the sound throughout the film was to show the dark times of the children who are committing terrible acts and the use of diegetic and non-diegetic sounds makes us feel like we are in the slums with them. The use of subtitles throughout the film worried me in the beginning but after a couple minutes, having to read everything the characters are saying makes it feel so much more real. I would rate this film a 7.4/10 as it is not a film for the faint of heart as there is much violence involving children but a film that moves its audience to realize what it is like in the slums of the City of God."
Priceless classic,Cleyton_melo,13 January 2021,10,"A great classic without an Oscar, a portrait of the favelas of Brazil that remains to this day among the poorest."
Review I wrote for Comparative Civilizations 12,ryna_m,4 November 2006,10,"""City of God"" left me feeling stunned, naïve and slightly guilty about my lack of knowledge concerning situations like the slum gangs of Rio de Janeiro. The characters seemed to exist with a sense of careless brutality. They were a generation of children, adolescent boys, and young men so used to the violence around them that they had become desensitized. I was expecting to feel extremely emotional by the end, simply because of the amount of graphic violence the film contained and the final death toll, but instead I was left with a surprising sense of detachment. To me though, the gang mentality seemed exactly that: detached, emotionally disconnected from reality and trapped in a vicious cycle of urban violence. It was particularly disturbing to see, for example, a group of boys perhaps nine to twelve-years old, walking calmly about the streets with guns in their hands and discussing the next person they would have to kill to better their lives. This film also highlighted widespread corruption within the Brazilian police force, showing cops eagerly taking bribes from gang members instead of making arrests. The movie managed to successfully inform me of a raw hostility found in many of these favelas or slum cities, but the characters did seem to be a bit romanticized for emotional impact. Visually, ""City of God"" was very realistic and compelling, the filming executed in such a way that the viewer would have to fight not to be pulled into the horrifying action. Although the rapidly advancing plot and large number of actors involved made this movie somewhat hard to follow at times, the general effect was very captivating and thought-provoking, and the ending seemed to come much too soon."
how things are,black-pookie,21 August 2013,8,It reflects well the life of low and high profiles in crime in Brazil. Genuinely shoot and with good actors and photography. It is fun and sad. Written in a way that gets you longing for what's happening next. I don't know how famous these actors are but they were good.
a perfect equilibrium..,jeanphizz,4 September 2006,8,"As I was told by some friends before watching it, ""city of god"" is indeed a masterpiece. One might say it's an easy comment : ""great"", ""cool"", ""very good"". So what makes it different form the other movies of this kind?"
One of the better movies I've watched,r-25195,29 June 2021,9,"The story begins in the present days, in the slum of 'Cidade de Deus' (city of god), with some bandits chasing a chicken. Then, a teenager called 'Rocket' tells the story of the Cidade de Deus and the main characters of the movie, since they were kids."
one of the best foreign film that I've seen.,juanaldisya,4 July 2021,9,This movie is beautifully narrated and presented in chapters.
Who are the complete dunces who gave this movie anything less than 10?,something127,24 October 2005,10,"This movie was and still is my favorite. No one will probably read this comment, its like #42, but I would like to put my two cents in anyway. My brothers and I found this movie in Blockbuster for $2.99. That was the worst ripoff Blockbuster has ever dealt with. That's like giving away heart surgery or something. I would have paid $2.99 to read the back cover. The cinematography was flawless. The storyline, though based on a true story, was an original and brilliant, unlike most movies. I am a Saving Private Ryan fan. The reality in both movies is, well, very real. It makes you feel sorrow when a hero dies, and joy when some triumph for the good guys happens. This is very rare in a movie. I must say, I was very impressed. It proves my theory, that a movie can only be good when the actors, directors, and crew are on the same page, and allow some deviations from the script."
The best brazilian movie!!!!,manoelalimacedo,14 July 2021,10,"Despised by the Oscar, it is an almost true construction of the reality that haunts parts of the country. Amazing how it was done! Leandro Firmino interpreting Zé pequeno is wordefull, as well as the Seu Jorge."
City of God Review,willcholman,2 September 2021,9,"City of God (or Cidade de Deus) shows life in the slums of Rio de Janeiro from the 1960s to the 1980s. Its aggressiveness and pace help show how the gritty gangs of the time infected the youth and any families close by. The children are the main perpetrators of violence in this movie which is nothing new for cinema, but in this case, the movie is based on a true story. The children are the focus of this movie most of them being introduced young. The characters introduced are all unique and the movie effortlessly shows you how the city changes them and grow up. The Protagonist, Rocket (Buscapé), has higher morals and doesn't want to involve himself in the gang life. He instead wants to become a photographer and when he takes photos of his everyday life in the slums, a big newspaper notices and his talent and ability to take photos in that area earn him a good reputation by the end of the film."
Best film,carlessileselmejor,18 September 2021,,"The film revolves around the, 'City of God,' a favela in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, a horrifying area drug dealers run the community, and where children killing children is not an uncommon occurrence."
THE BEST,masterdonada,2 December 2021,10,"O MELHOR FILME QUE EXISTE NO MUNDO SOBRE O MUNDO. Seriously, the way this encapsulates the country is amazing and has amazing sites in Rio, definitely recommend this is you are getting into Brazilian film and definitely look ash the writers other works. Lots of hidden gems in this film."
Such a great movie,xerato-67810,4 December 2021,10,"This very long movie is entirely in Portuguese (what I call the devil's language). Yet, you quickly get sucked in and no longer notice you're reading subtitles. The story is more or less that of 2 boys in the hood, one who wants to be a photographer. The other follows a very Scarface-esquire path to rise to the peak of gangsterdom. Oddly, while neither one helps the other on purpose, neither could achieve what they did without the other."
Great film,pvlvantonnn,19 January 2022,10,"The other day we reviewed with my husband the film ""One plus One (1 + 1)"" (2011) and today my review will be about this film."
Gas🔥🔥,tobrockman,28 February 2022,10,I've heard this movie in English one time only and when I tell you I absolutely loved it. It's lit 🔥 the fact that it is so hard to get it in English today is mind blowing I've been looking for the guy that sold me the English version.
Instrumental as a tool for film makers,Tristan_Collins,4 February 2019,10,If you want to calibrate your film maker compass to a status quo let this movie be your instrument. The story comes before the name of the actors involved. A true diamond.
A masterpiece of Brazilian culture,Kallizera,17 March 2022,10,"This film is to shock, representing a reality, of the crime, of the people who live in the favelas, at the same time it shocks, teaches, step by step how to become a villain."
a meaningful movie,n-45931,31 May 2022,9,"When I watch this movie,I was thinking will this city of god will be peace again? The answer is no. In my opinion, Although the gang boss had dead,there will be another. I can't imagine a real place where this actually happens."
best film I've seen in a long time,JMMelo,27 August 2002,10,"I try to go to the movies as often as I can, but for some reason (time, price, and a little prejudice, I'll admit)I don't get to see as many Brazilian films as I should. Brazilian cinema improved greatly since it came from under the wing of Embrafilme, the national film agency, and Brazilian directors are finally seeing that we can show our reality in a non-cheesy, non-Americanized, non-stereotyped way, while still being smart and commercial."
city of god/ city of crimes,ugurcankayaci,29 July 2022,9,"A good movie about crime and children. On the one hand, children who are prone to crime, on the other hand, a child who works for his dreams regardless of the environment and is a photographer. ""Two wrongs don't make a right."""
One of the best movies out there,bebelfleck,14 March 2023,9,"I grew up knowing of this film and hearing how amazing it was. But never did I think it was going to change my life as much as it did. Coming from Brazil this movie shows the problems our people face and the emotions each character faces. If you want a recommendation for a international film this is it. This is the one you need to watch. Ever since I've seen this film I haven't found one that gets to this level. Be ready to cry, get scared and love characters that show the real story of Brazilian people. I love it and I know you will too, and please, don't forget to watch it in Portuguese, so you get the full immersion of the film!"
The Movie of the new world,Tarushijio,13 January 2003,10,"Hello, you saw this movie?  Did like? So, vote in City Of God. This movie needs enter in the Top movies. Fernando Meirelles, in your second movie, did this incredible action movie. Please, enjoy and vote in this best movie of this year."
Flat out Brilliant. totally deserving of the top 20.,tokensgarage,22 March 2008,10,"I had a high level expectation before watching this movie, which for me is a big gamble. Did it deliver? it did, in spades."
Amazing.,JhAgA,12 October 2002,10,"For the first time in many years I watched a film that made me laugh, happy, sad, shocked, nervous and relieved altogether."
Perfection,zeph865,24 March 2003,10,"Every aspect of this film--story, directing, camera work, acting, characters, score--was perfect. This is the best I film I have seen in a very very long time."
A masterpiece if there ever was one...,goastros36,31 March 2020,10,"Phenomenal film from top to bottom. Amazing writing, directing, acting, and cinematography. And it sticks close to the actual events. Well worth the watch."
Deserves every award,sur_real,18 September 2003,,"City of God is without doubt one of the greatest films ever made, and it has been a while since a movie of this calibre was screened internationally. Comparisons to classic ""gangster"" films like Goodfellas are not without reason, but the context of this movie gives the themes a different meaning altogether."
The best movie of 2002,umary10,12 November 2002,10,"It´s certainly one of the best film of the last decade. A masterpiece!!! The actors, photography, screenplay, music, sound effects, direction are superb. Now, Brazil probably win the Oscar for foreign film. The brazilian cinema shines: Central Station, Lavoura Arcaica, Behind the Sun, Madame Satã, and now this wonderful City of God!!!"
"A GREAT story, wonderfully told. So Gripping.",jonjo20,10 January 2003,10,"This film is a genuinely great piece of film making. A STORY. A real cracking story, it has a sense of epic about it. The acting is superb. The direction clear.  This is really gripping stuff."
You must run to see the movie!!!,alanroger,3 January 2003,10,"If you haven`t seen this movie yet, you must run and see. You won`t lose your time and your money. City of God is an amazing and brutal film and I am sure it will win the Golden Globe and the Oscar of the best fereign film. I am shure City of God is the best Brazilian film ever made."
Not only one more movie...,b-boop,5 January 2003,10,"Cidade de Deus is a masterpiece. Some movies becomes more than an entertainment movie, more than a history."
I'd give this movie an 11 if I could,jamesey,19 March 2003,10,"The editing, the story, the screenplay, the music...It's all pure brilliance. From the opening scene I was sucked in and I couldnt wait until I could see the finish at the end of the movie. Until then though, there is a terrific story about growing up in 3rd world slums."
Knowing more about third world exclusion vicious circle,Bouguereau,13 January 2003,10,"Yes. It is, indeed, a violent film. It`s shocking sometimes. And, sometimes, it is shocking how we betray ourselves laughing when watching some scenes that would make other people cry, or acting normally when situation claim us to react negatively to what we are seeing on the screen. If you feel like this, than maybe you've succeeded in becoming part of City of God`s world. That`s what happens when you live in a reality like this 24 h a day. Violence becomes usual and you start to see things in a different perspective. Or, I could say that, people have to get a life, even when their environment fights against them. Believe me. I live in Brazil, so, in some aspects, I know what it is. What else can I say? Well, just try to watch this movie with an open minded heart. It has a great plot and a great photography, but, to me, the most important of all is that this movie shows the universal problem of exclusion and opression and how things can turn into a vicious circle if there`s no one to break it."
Master piece!!!!!!,emilioaugusto,24 January 2003,,"One of the best brazilian movies, including Central Station (Walter Salles) and Pixote (Hector Babenco)!!It shows a real civil war that we live nowadays in Brazil. Fernando Meirelles made a real masterpiece!! Now Its time to win The Oscar!!! Please, forget Pinocchios..."
This movie is great!,alextfreitas,27 March 2003,10,"This is one of the best movies of the year, no doubt. Shame on the academy for not even indicating for an Oscar, it definitely deserved one. The violence is shocking, but not less present than 'Private Ryan', 'Gangs of NY', etc. It's even more disturbing because it's based on a true story. Very well made and keeps you interested the whole time. Go watch it!"
Beautifully told story w/ an intricately woven plot and a barage of interesting/real characters.,WyldStallyn,29 January 2003,,"I had the priviledge of seeing this movie at the Telluride Film Festival this year and immediately fell in love. I believe it was the best film shown there - even better than 'Bowling for Columbine' or 'Frida'(although these were very, very, good). Its twisted storyline and large number of characters identified only by gang nick-names, is reminicent of movies like 'Pulp Fiction,' 'Resovior Dogs' or 'Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels/Snatch'(because 'Lock, Stock...' and 'Snatch' are essentially the same movie). In fact, when recommending it to friends, I describe it as ""A Brazilian Guy Ritchie/Tarantino-esque Film(yes, you can quote me on that)."" City of God's description of the corrupt city near Rio de Janero is very strong and persuasive. Its actors seem like they are not acting at all - which is in fact, true. The director went to this city and offered the natives acting lessons as simple classes they could take. But, in reality, he was really holding auditions for the film! Genious idea if you are trying to capture reality instead of bringing in fake, over-aged, Hollywood, no-talent models, putting them in native clothing, placing guns in their hands and expecting them to do the job. ""But enough of my yackin',"" as Rob Reiner narrates in 'This is Spinal Tap,' go out and see what a call a foreign masterpiece for yourself."
Masterpiece!,seyhmusergin,15 October 2018,10,"One of the most convincing, exciting and sensational gang-drug-growth movie of all time. After you see that film, you won't be able to stand workaday,mediocre films of this genre."
Drugs murder and love,erkas,26 October 2003,10,"City of God take us into the 60-70´s Ghettos of ""Rio de Janiero"". A place where young gangsters are gods. Its a true story about a boy called ""Rocket"", and he decide to not partipate in anything that has to do with crime. This after his big brother who also was a gangster got killed by a little kid. This little kid grow up to be the bíggest ganster in the ""City of God"". And no matter how much ""Rocket"" try to stand outside he always run into these gangsters. The only way out of this is the camera. But its also a love story about a young man ""Rocket"" who sees how all the other guys loose their virginity except him. And how looses his girlfriend to his best friend. The movie i think gives a realistic view how it is to grow up in the ghettos where the fastest way to respect is money. And fastest way to get money is drugs and crime. If you havent seen the movie, i promise you get yourself something to think about afterwards."
"A new Brazilian Classic: a most excellent, creative film",barnhart-3,7 February 2003,,"City of God was one of the most thought provoking films that I have seen in years. The movie bears slight resemblance to ""Trainspotting"" in character although its content is far superior because it is based on real people living out real situations. It gives us a glimpse into human nature in a way that few films have ever attempted. The docudrama-styled filming of the movie transports the audience unconditionally. This film deserves an Oscar!"
Masterpiece in Cinema,jarmuschjones,24 February 2003,10,"As soon as this movie was over, I wanted to see it again. When I went back to see it a few days later I was disappointed to see that it was already gone. Hopefully it will be released in more theaters soon. City of God jumped immediately to my top ten list of all time. I give this movie a 10 and I've only given maybe five others that score. Great story-This is based on a true story, which always makes a movie more intriguing to me. Great directing-can't wait for his next film. Great acting from a cast of mostly non-professionals-Some characters were very likeable and it was sad when they passed and others you couldn't wait until they got whacked. Awesome cinematography-this stood out from any other movie in a long time, and it alone was worth the 9 bucks. If this is playing near you go see it before anything else, you won't be disappointed. It is pretty graphic and there are a few unsettling scenes of kids killing kids, but I thought that just made the movie that much stronger. Only one word can describe this movie...perfect. So if you can handle a little violence, don't hesitate,go see it..NOW."
"A ""neoverism"" dramatic film",vincenzomartemucci,22 June 2014,9,"A film that teaches you in a whirlwind of violence, despair and resignation only those who have a strong conscience and determination survive without killing someone."
Magnificent! Superb!,giuice,9 March 2003,10,"In the line of direction of Pulp Fiction (Tarantino) City of God has a suffocating and amused  rhythm, from the start to the end, with an incredible script and direction. I have no doubts, The best film that i have ever seen!!!."
outstanding,johnmurraylfc,15 March 2003,10,"Just when you think you have seen it all. This Powerful movie puts Hollywood to shame when you witness something as beautiful this Hypnotic as city of God. It was so easy to be seduced by the Tender Trio,Lil Zeand the lovable Benny The scene with the child was way too close for comfort this is an outstanding piece of art,fast paced twists and turns to a brilliant degree of separation this is the whole reason WHY WE LOVE THE MOVIES go and treat your self funny violent soft and fierce love of survival makes City of God a ten it is a keeper when it comes out on vid/dvd."
Some comments,joost-schreurs,24 July 2010,8,"I really liked the movie and I think all the positive things about it are said in the reviews below, but I just couldn't resist adding some criticism to it."
Excellent,nunoalf,26 April 2003,10,"it has one of the best movies i ever saw, the actor´s are real and that became one of the many surprises of this film. the picture of the movie is exactly the same of the country ( Brasil ) violence,puberty, good looking women. very good in did."
Competes for all-time top honors,daarkmonkey-850-544035,21 September 2010,10,"While perhaps not the best film ever made, City of God clearly competes for top honors. While the heart of the movie is a tragedy about the effects of crime and poverty in the slums of Rio de Janeiro, it does not treat it's viewer as a torture subject. There are many tragedies, both minor and major, that befall the characters. The life in a Rio slum is not portrayed as a fairy tale world, however, there are moments of joy, love, and fun. The script itself would make City of God a great movie, but it was also very well conceived. The camera direction is fast-paced and modern without being overly jumpy, the actors all play their roles naturally, and the production value is incredibly high (especially considering the relatively modest budget.) At once a very serious and thought-provoking film, City of God perfectly balances serious subject matter and a high level of entertainment in a way I have not yet seen any other film achieve."
Eye-opening movie,rachelfkruger,17 July 2011,7,"First of all, the acting in this movie was outstanding. Many of the actors came from real situations similar to those in the movie, which made it easier for them to become the character. The way violence was portrayed in this movie was excellent. It showed the mercilessness of the killers and it evoked a sense of reality, unlike average Hollywood violence. The way people were killed made you think: ""Wow. These things really happen this way."" The relationships among characters, and the characters themselves were very realistic. They weren't stereotypical ""Good guys"" or ""Bad guys."" Each one had a complex mix of thoughts, actions, and emotions. The storyline, although very interesting and thought-provoking, was rather complicated. Every so often, the narrator stops the story to explain a character or situation by going back in time, and tells that particular story up until it's the present day, and goes back to the story. Also, due to how many characters are in the movie, it's sometimes hard to keep track of who's who. Especially when the story advances to years later, when characters have grown up, and sometimes change names. All in all, this was a very good movie; one that shows people what the world is really like. It shows how dangerous and depressing slums can be."
Fantastic story and direction.,darkfo0l,23 June 2003,10,"A fantastic film, presented in a raw and gripping form. Simply unforgettable. Another great film in the recent few that have shown rough life in southern America. I urge any fans of GREAT FILMS to check this one out. Cop that!"
Ultimate Film,Skyturk92,28 July 2011,10,"I just finished the movie and all i can say is awesome. Awesome awesome awesome. This movie's director must be a genius that uses amateur players this well. When i saw the crying kid(its not a big spoiler) i doubt that if this is a movie or a real story with a hidden cam. I didn't read the novel but if its better then movie, then that will be the ultimate book. I won't tell the main story but know only this. You will never regret that 2 hours. But be warned, watch this movie extremely carefully from the beginning to the end, because the names can be mixed because they are talking in Portuguese i think, and they are telling the names very differently. Names are a whole another story. So you have to watch this movie without giving any break. My last word again is, awesome."
Just a short comment...,cknalha,19 June 2003,10,"It's just the best brazilian film, of all the times! É simplesmente o melhor fime brasileiro, de todos os tempos!"
One of the best non-hollywood films out there,veskoukisandreas,24 August 2018,10,One of the most iconic movies of all time. This is a must see for anyone that wants to broaden their views and watch something otherr than the typical hollywood production.
So real that frightens.,manjarin69,1 July 2003,10,"The film is really good. I have suggested it to all my friends, although advising them that the images are one of most violent that i have seen. Not for the blood or the shoots, it is for the protagonists, majority of them children of less than one meter."
An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind,ihyou50,8 May 2014,10,"Captivated for 130 minutes. I was riveted and couldn't take my eyes of the screen, constantly wondering what was going to happen next. It was so real and raw that you do not think that these are actors at all, they are dregs in the slums of Rio De Jeniro. I am convinced that Lil' Ze is in fact a homicidal gangster thirsty for power who will do anything to keep control and his rule with an iron fist, or brass knuckles. Throughout this whole movie you will see the pattern: for every action is a reaction...tit for tat, you killed my brother now I'm gonna f*ck you over, you insult me I'm going to humiliate you, you killed my Dad now I'm gonna join this gang and exact revenge. Overtones of power struggle and egoism that plague humanity on the deepest levels not just in the ghetto's of Brazil but here in present day Detroit or New Orleans, Atlanta, LA, etc. As many were killed in City Of God, what did it solve? Nothing, in the end, the two ""leaders"" were both dead and a new younger gang took over and someone will probably off them and a new more virile gang will replace the last and so on and so on. It's a vicious cycle that youth get caught in but the one boy was able to break the cycle and use his mind instead of fist and become a photographer. Great story and cast. Cannot find one flaw. Edgy true life drama."
Entrancing,MaryBT2012,3 May 2011,10,"I watched this film in my Portuguese class and I was amazed! I literally forgot that I was watching the movie in subtitles because I was so drawn in by the storyline. The story is told very well and even the parts that were easy to predict happened in a way that kept my attention. The movie starts out showing a scene in which Rocket thinks he is being chased, although the scene doesn't make sense until much later it introduces the most memorable quote in the movie: If you run they will chase you, if you stay they will eat you. After watching the movie the truth of this quote reigns supreme. The actors were amazing and it translated well to me even though it's a foreign film. I was happy to see that this movie received several Oscar nominations because it definitely deserved them. Job well done!"
one of the best movies I have seen for years,comfactory,8 August 2003,10,unbelieveable... usually the movie that seems like taking 4 hours is claimed like a boring movie. This one is not like that. It so well directed and edited and shooted that it really seems like it is 4 hours long but you as an audience really DO NOT WANT THIS STORY TO END... At least I had that feeling. Great.
Chizel my Nizel,rubgonzales,16 November 2003,10,"This was one of my favorite films.  Despite the fact that I don't understand Brazilian and it had English caption I still got into the movie.  Why is it one of my favorite films?  Because it made me laugh, cry, move in my seat, and cringe.  This is exactly what a great film does."
High Expectations Fulfilled,davelegge,28 January 2004,10,"I borrowed this film off of one of my friends yesterday, with high expectations having read many reviews complimenting it beyond belief. As he handed it to me i was warned, 'Oh, and by the way its in Brazilian... But there are subtitles'. I stood for a minute wondering if this meant i wasn't going to enjoy it, as his warning sounded exactly as if this meant the film was rubbish. I sat down to watch later on, feeling confused, but high in expectation. I had wanted to see this since it had been released, but it did not come out at my local cinema and i haven't had time to buy it. Five minutes into the film and i felt as if i spoke fluent Brazilian, i no longer realised i was having to read the subtitles, i had become so involved in what was happening on the screen. Great film making tied in with a brilliant story (which is true apparently), and something about managed to set it apart from other gangster movies. Its realism. I felt it happening in reality as i watched it explode on screen. I finished watching it and paused, to think about what i had just seen. I felt completely satisfied. The movie had beaten my expectations by a mile, they had been good... But the film was very good! The Godfather may be the greatest film ever, Goodfellas may be close, and Scarface may be a gangster movie to compete with any other, but City Of God is the best 'gangster' film i have ever seen."
A good movie,lucky8213,25 January 2005,,"I had been reading an article about this movie published in Brazil which could be translated into something like ""The Cosmetics of Violence"" In this article the writer critizes the filmmakers for glamorizing the violence through slick edits and kinetic camera work."
"city of god, blown away",wobblyheaded,13 February 2004,,"When i first walked into angelika theatre downtown i didnt know what to expect exept that i heard from a friend of mine that this movie was awsome. as i was watching this i thought to myself, i havent seen a movie this good i cant remember when, seriously, after i saw it and heard this was the directors first work, i couldent believe it. for those who are in dire need to see a truely great film this is certainly for you and the next person over."
Top Entertainment,ian-foster-1,7 January 2004,10,"This is the best film I have seen this year, and I loved Return of The King and am a massive Tolkien fan."
"This is one of the freshest, must unique films every made, it is at least best picture of the year",EnjoyYourWorries,3 January 2004,10,"The directing on this movie alone draws you in. So vivid, brutal, and realistic. It gives off incredible atmosphere which lets you fell like you are actually in this place. The characters are captivating, while the story is historically fascinating. 10 out of 10. Perfect. Go see it now if you haven't already. If you've already seen it, see it again."
Real and Shocking!,adrifm,22 January 2004,9,"This film was simply one of the chocking films marcantes and that already attended, therefore portrays a reality that is for times forgotten and hidden. In accomplishment terms I find that it is spectacular! Without a doubt one of the best films and without being American. Chocking Real and is the words that describe this film."
almost forgot i was watching it movie. it was so real!,thesebadstreets,15 February 2004,,"i've never seen anything that seemed so real to me. this blew away reservoir dogs, and at one point and time i couldn't imagine anything being as real and actually scary as reservoir dogs. this movie blew me away. just when i thought all of the insanity had faded and the characters would evntually come to their senses, i was back to holding my mouth in disbelief. and to find out at the end that some of the events were based on a true story. this made me so happy to not have had to live in that kind of environment. i've told all of my friends about this movie and i hope they can escape from the buls*** movies that north american media pumps up. real movies lie in the hands of artists and directors that create and bring you to see and make you believe that what they are offering to you is practical or can actually happen. it was hard to believe that something like this could have ever happened, but the perfect set up of the movie looked so god damn real. i felt like i would walk outside to rio and almost forgot i was watching a movie. goddamn! this was so good."
Best movie ever,aptheking,25 July 2013,10,I think City of God is one of the best movies ever because of the storyline and because of the actors. It is a perfect working story you can see again and again and again.
Violence and Art (minimal spoiler),spudhalvorson-1,23 January 2005,8,"The artistry in this movie is colorful, as is the graphic violence. One must wonder in this day and age where art ends and pure visceral contrivance begins. Yet another ""based"" on a true story films, this movie paints the day to day violence of the 1960-80's slums of Rio DE Janeiro with a eclectic yet predictable color: red. By the end of the movie you are grateful our hero has escaped the pains of his upbringing, but you may be unsure you needed to relive it along side of him. -An artfully crafted film, the director takes us through a series of flashbacks, ending the film from where we began. This of course has been done before, and although I like the directors method of composition, in several sections we actually watch a couple of segments through twice over. Gentlemen, this is not a good date movie."
Impressive,muratdurmus1992,24 September 2016,10,"This is one of the best movies ever due to the closeness to the reality of the acting and scenes. I am not sure if this is based on a real story as the movie says, but what I can say is that people still lives the City of God in all over the world. Still, good people and children die for nothing. In Brasil, Middle East, Asia, Africa, people die for nothing. Like, it is shown in the movie, good people die for the benefit of the bad people. It is always been like this in the history and still going on. And the director shows the corruption in the 70s and 80s in Brasil. The story is really catchy and you don't get bored. Acting of the performers is tremendous. From the youngest to the oldest every performer deserves the Oscar."
You can't under rate a film like this,esteele-1,20 March 2004,,"This is a truly fantastic film. The art direction, cinematography and overall style is easily better than any movie up for an Oscar this year. It is unfortunate (due both to the release timing and Oscar timing) that this film was not up for Best Picture."
Esteban Bolanos-City of God,esteban_24,14 June 2012,10,"In my Film Appreciation class we just saw the Brazilian movie ""City of God"" directed by Fernando Meirelles. The movie takes place on the famous Favelas in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The history is about two major gangs in this area that are fighting to gain the control of the business (drugs). This movie includes a lot of action and drama."
Outstanding,jlorrimer,23 April 2004,10,"Although a lot of people have commented on the horror of this excellent film, I've yet to read any comments about it's humour. From the opening scene with the escape attempt by the chicken I knew I was going to enjoy this film and like Pulp Fiction and Good Fellas (though I didn't really want to compare) there's enough laugh out loud dialogue (the hot banana?) to pluck you back into the comfort zone and pull your jaw from the floor after the more harrowing scenes. The scenes with Benni are particularly heart warming, although you always kinda know you are being led down a path that will eventually lead to a sticky end. Some people have suggested there's too much realistic violence in City of God. Well .. if you prefer the pantomime violence of films like Lethal Weapon or Beverly Hills Cop then you don't deserve to see films as good as this."
Violence is a reality,lucia_vf,17 May 2004,,"City of God is the name of one of the poorest areas of the glamorous Rio de Janeiro. Despite its name, it seems that God does not usually come that way and it is perfectly normal, because he could go out with a bullet in his head. The film tells the story of two boys that were born in City of God who become two people totally different - one an honest photographer's apprentice and the other a dangerous drug dealer. But the main subject is not poverty or drugs, which are present throughout the film, it is violence."
Weapon of Knowledge,leosgf,25 May 2004,10,"This film is a superb instrument to show the world how all the mechanisms of the violence factory works in Brazil and in many others cities around the world. All the governors of the world must see this movie to learn to learn how not to run a city, a country or anything else."
Has there been a better foreign film?,days_dan_confused,21 June 2004,10,Wow.. this film is a real knockout. 'boys in the hood' meets 'once were warriors'.... but on the harsh brazen and always brash streets of 1960's Rio De Janeiro.
one of the best i have ever seen...,hurstwb3,9 June 2004,10,"I was blown away by this movie, definitely one of the top ten best i have ever seen. There is not one bad thing i could say about his movie, it was always moving forward and constantly kept your interest level high. The acting was brilliant all the way around. The realness the movie offers i cannot compare to any other film. The closest thing that it resembles is a Larry Clark type movie(Kids, Bully)but far above and beyond those. I can't say enough good things to justify how amazing this movie is.Totally shocking, you just have to see it for yourself to understand. Also to add, i am no fan of subtitles but the way this movie moves you hardly notice you are reading, its just that damn good."
Campbell's quality film: mm mm good.,THEAnastassia,22 June 2004,8,"Liked it. In fact, Loved it a little bit. Even from the opening scene...a chicken? What? I'll tell you what...slick characters whose humor is lost in translation, awesome drug-dealing Funk kings...I loved how you know it was ""The Sixties"" and that this was ""Knock Out Ned's Story"" And hot damn...the Story of the Apartment was bloody grand. Wasn't what I expected at all...and I think I laughed at the wrong parts, but for once the case didn't lie. ""One of the best films you'll ever see."" And it was. And I liked it. And I didn't hate it. **** 1/2 stars, says she. and see it if you haven't had the pleasure. If for nothing else there's a very happy paper salesman in the movie."
it can be described as well as a dramatic situation,ozersenaa,25 July 2014,10,"You may be a child. You may be a happy or unhappy child. Poor or rich. Sick or healthy. Doctor, nurse, grabber or anything you want to be. You can everything when you are little. Thanks to the imagination, all of them easy to be. And you can be adult easily. But being a real adult is really quite compelling and complicated. Live like an adult, even being forced to live like a bigger.. Exactly where you will find true life in the face tiny bodies. They will give the innocence in evil. You will understand acting an innate talent that has not been learned. You will be disappointed from time to time and sometimes you will laugh because they are so natural. It is very natural for you to feel like in the film's inevitable. I think the most important films be viewed again and again."
A great character driven gritty story,natalierose7677,31 December 2012,9,"The story of several boys growing up in Rio De Janeiro, the different paths their lives take but how they also keep intertwining. The subtitles didn't take anything away from this film and it is beautifully acted. The character driven storyline makes you really root for the boys and evoked real feelings of sadness and empathy when I watched it. It is similar to stories such as The Kite Runner, where you see the characters grow and evolve into young men. There are quite a few violent scenes but all are necessary to give a proper insight into the characters' lives and are not gratuitously drawn out. The film is set in the 60's and 70's which provides a few hilarious moments with clothing and scenery."
A frightening future,seppo-mlkki,8 October 2004,,I saw this film recently in a film studio in a small Swedish town and noted that the makers have in a way surpassed Tarantino. I am very impressed by the cutting an visualization of the story.
The Hardness Beauty of Rio.,Dominic-Bueno,2 December 2017,10,"Despite beautiful beaches and a charismatic people, Rio showed us what in the movie in the mid-1960s was inside the normality, a fight between the police and drug dealers. At the film, Rocket tell us the history inside of the favela, where the fights between drug dealers, introduce even children in this world, when Li'l Dice became Li'l Zé and started to kill people at his childhood with his his partner but not killer Benny."
"Amazing, Just see it",carlsarevalo,11 October 2016,10,"Based on a true story of drugs and corruption on Brazil, this movie is amazing, so as photograph as acting and text. Is really important (and sad to the same time) what that happened in this movie,applies today's in some country of the world and still Happen. The acting of children's and how the director shows the favela day by day is really hard. Is a strong drama, where the drugs, the poor and narcotrafficking take the first role. Is no time for love in this film. I think that this movie is the point of start to the Brazilian movies in a worldwide way, And the same time is an icon in latinoamerican cult movie, that you must see."
My thoughts of City of God,danielnewman595,4 September 2013,10,"This movie is possibly one of my favorite foreign films that i have seen largely due to its outstanding cinematography, its detailed story, and the degree of shocking realism it was executed with. This movie definitely gives someone like me, who has never been to Rio De Janero, Brazil a taste of how dangerous and poverty stricken the area really is. This movie gives an insiders look of how local kids of Rio De Janero often easily get involved into gang activities such as murder, drug dealing, and drug use at an extremely young age. This movie also shows how one local caught in this mess of violence and drug abuse is able to improve his life and find his way out of this poverty stricken area. I recommend this movie to anyone who does not mind reading subtitles and likes a good gang movie."
Real Favela Life,NilsZahirovic,2 January 2014,9,"A movie about the life of a young boy who gets in love with his photocamera. After taking a picture of a famous favela gang, who appears in the local newspaper, he gets the opportunitie to go deeper in the ganglife by taking pictures of the gangsters."
"""Best film you'll ever see."" indeed.",mauthausen_st,19 April 2007,,"For the 130 minutes of this movie, one is transported into the brazen unyielding world of the slums where the characters live. The cinematography and editing accurately reflect life and the various point of view. Searing orange and yellow landscapes, cold blues and murky shadows- the color palette itself is a visual work of art. Even with the fast paced narration, it still brings a sense of depth, unlike other films where the fast pace and the director's style overwhelm the characterization and heart of the movie."
action-packed. don't be deceived by the sexy picture,supercool1234,4 March 2014,,"I enjoyed this movie a lot, and it was pretty much what you would expect after seeing the trailer. Lots of gun violence, drugs, pretty nice cinematography."
Must watch before dying type of movie,tracy_mendiola,1 December 2017,10,"I'm a tough critic and I never give out 10's to anything because 10's are unicorns, they don't exist. There is always something wrong with any movie no matter how well it is made, except for City of God. Alright, enough with the act. This really is a masterpiece no matter what age you are, where you're from, or what your financial income is, you will find a way to relate and empathize. There is something to be learned from this film not just morally but in a more philosophical way once you get to see all perspectives in the story. I don't want to say too much so just watch the movie and enjoy. :)"
"- ""Cidade De Deus?"" ""IDK"" .",ariaquie,23 March 2014,9,"Er, As I start writing this review I got a lot of thoughts about how people think about my county that I hate and love at the same time. The best here is the people, the place, the feelings that we all get that we are loved and that we have a amazing life, but then it comes the worst part, that is the peoples mid in here. Everybody thinks so little about themselves and agree even when it's not right, we are so complacent about everything that's wrong here and the others getting well on other people shoulders. I hate the fact that we are so accommodated that not even thinking straight about what's going here and what can we do to change the chaos. To change is never a idea. Sometimes I think Brazilians fear their governments, I don't know why, maybe is because they have a degree in law or any other diploma, so, people here are afraid of other people that they say is smarted than them? So, We will never grow to a strong country. We are ashamed of what we produced and we don't love what we have in here, people give more value to foreign than to each other. I never liked City Of God, I always said that it was too much, but, hey, I watched this film first time when I was twelve years old, so I indeed was too much for a child that the only mean haven seen in her country was what her father said to her, like - ""Some mean people robber your uncle cellphone"" or, whatever, things that happen everywhere, but What I'm trying to say is - ""I'm not proud of this movie"" Even if it shows what's the real reality of my country, still it makes me sad. Is nice film, but I always wished it was film in another place. So this is my first review, it's a weak, but I'll try to get better and hey, English isn't my first language."
This is the best movie that i have see..,dirrty85,27 July 2017,9,I love this movie. I have seen it 10 times and it's so Amazing.. This is the best movie that i have see.. it is a realistic drama woh i think that's real.. it is old but its really good. i give 9 stars ... That is my first time that i write a review but for this movie is that OK. I hope my English its good to reading .
ONE OF THE BEST FROM BRAZIL,hernie22,25 May 2018,10,"It would be rather cheap to tag City Of God ""the South American Goodfellas"", as if every region of the world is somehow entitled to at least one gangster masterpiece in the freewheeling Scorsese tradition. (Where, you might ask, is the British Goodfellas?) However, since the audience for a two-hour-plus Brazilian movie might not show without some strong encouragement, let's make this clear: City Of God is the South American GoodFellas."
The Hype and Acclaim is Real,Nabil_alwaili,5 May 2018,8,"City of God was a study in brutality. Offending all of the senses, the movie proceded in using a multisensory approach to capture the very essence of violence, in every sense of the word. Human beings of every age were tortured and murdered. A main character was depicted inflicting multiple injuries and deaths while laughing hysterically. I had to wonder what the point of the movie was. Any claim to artistic expression evaded me, entirely"
An excellent depiction of fatalism.,truebiger,16 July 2017,10,"The depicted violence in Cidade de Deus (Meirelles & Lund) – whether within the city or within its characters – gets explained in a variety of different ways but is ultimately presented as something beyond comprehension or escape. While at some points motives are suggested, they appear insufficient to account for the pervasiveness and level of violence. Additionally, all articulated alternatives to violence get eventually undermined."
Love this movie,hdotross,11 November 2022,9,"Still one of my all time favorites. Think this movie was the first movie I ever watched all the way through that had subtitles lol. I loved everything about this movie; the story, the characters, the cast, the location and the cinematography. I remember putting the movie in the dvd player thinking it would make good background noise as I attempted to go to sleep while on a road trip. Before I knew it the movie was over and I was still wanting more. Think I had to watch it like 4 more times that month lol. Actually talking about it now makes me want to go watch. If you haven't seen this film I strongly suggest it."
Divisor of Waters of Brazilian Cinema!,intuospost,18 July 2018,10,Amazing to have been part of the post-production of this work of art made 100% in Brazil! Divisor of Waters of Brazilian Cinema!
Reality in Brazil,turrbo,9 November 2018,10,"Even though this is a movie and not a documentary. It depicts a reality and the potential of what you should be prepared for if you visit certain countries. This is a excellent movie from the standpoint: It is reality. Gangs on motorbikes ripping purses, wallets, jewelry. To take it a step further motorbike gangs that kill. Its a definite advantage and it is an excellent training movie before going on a trip to visit these types of countries. Its not only the motorbike scenario but also the gang mentality and being super aware of the possibilities. These types of things can also happen in the USA and UK as well as other supposedly friendly countries. This is a movie that enlightens and addresses these factors probably without the intention of doing so. It will help you be more prepared of what to expect and how to prepare and keep you thinking on your toes."
BRAZIL'S BEST FILM EVER MADE,GUI_TENSOL,27 March 2019,10,"As a Brazilian filmmaker myself, I attest that Cidade de Deus (City of God) still is, 17 years after its release, the best film we've ever made."
"INCREDIBLE, it's like real life..",adbasset,29 November 2018,9,"One of the best Foreign language movies i've ever watched, it's amazingly written and performed.
It felted so close to the reality of RIO GANGS LIFESTYLE..
I definitely recommend this movie from Brazil."
A wonderful example of poverty in Brazil and the struggles the citizens face with gangs.,mdias-91655,14 October 2016,9,"This film is not for the faint of heart; it is a very saddening film that puts aspects of the third world in Brazil into a very clear perspective. For an English speaker, like myself, I had to experience the movie through subtitles, but it did not take away from the impact of the film. I would recommend this film to anyone, it is an incredible experience. The film is based on a young boy in the world of Brazil's capital, Rio de Janeiro, and the struggles that himself, his family, and his friends face throughout their lives. The protagonist Buscape, or ""Rocket"" in the English subtitles, is a young aspiring photographer attempting to make his way out of the slums that his whole life is based around. Within these slums, the gangs in the area are active, and very violent. Rocket gets a hold of a second-hand camera and begins to take charge of his dream to be a photographer. As the gangs in the area become unsettled, and power begins to shift, a violent turf war begins. Rocket, seizing the opportunity, takes pictures of the action as it unfolds around him. He begins to submit his photos to the local newspaper, and winds up getting a job. It is an amazing film experience and really opens the viewers eyes to the challenges of the third world, and how prevalent poverty is, and how it is ignored regularly."
"The reality, not only of the favela, but of all Brazilian society, is masterfully represented by Fernando Meirelles in Cidade de Deus",fernandocarielo,26 November 2016,10,"City of God is a stunning film, it demonstrates without shame the Relations between the residents of the most marginalized regions of the country:Favelas.In this environment are told stories of love, crime, Revenge and dreams; Such stories involve emotionally, in addition to Instigating a more critical and reflective look at our own society. The directional technique used by Fernando Meirelles is another strong point of the film, its way of presenting the characters in a simple and fast way brings to the film an enthusiastic tone that incites the curiosity and the identification with such personages, providing an exceptional cinematographic experience!"
SHIZNIT,masonhubbard,8 March 2019,9,"Film was good, better than bamboozled."
"Ignore the over-sensitive reviewers, ignore the over-hyped praise.",o-48828,18 March 2017,6,"This is a good film, but that's about it. If you were to read the reviews here, you'll see that people say it's the greatest film ever or one of the worst, most disgusting things ever that tests the limits of free expression and is a candidate for censorship."
The Review for City of God,sanamkhan-66361,2 June 2017,,"Normally Brazilian cinema is strong in good comedy but rather unhappy with respect to dramatic films. However, this film is quite different. Most of the action takes place in one of the largest and most dangerous areas of Rio de Janeiro, the so-called ""favela"" Cidade de Deus (favela is the name that Brazilians give to the slums, where the poorest live, in the midst of total misery). There, people live alongside with crime, knowing that it may be the last day of their lives and having few opportunities to rise in life. In fact, this is not a movie thing, this is reality. The film merely uses reality to stage a story in which two young people take different life paths: one ends up becoming a photographer and the other becomes a drug dealer. These stories are fiction but they are very similar to the lives of immense young people who live in that place. And that's the great advantage of this deeply shocking movie: we know it's all fiction but it could be true."
Realism,pietroweb,24 June 2017,8,Realistic realistic movie brings you into that world It makes you understand what They are the faves that show you live to really see the cocks Realistic realistic movie brings you into that world It makes you understand what They are the navel's that show you live to really see the cocks
City of God,tmizdrak,16 October 2017,8,"City of God was a fantastic film that had you on the edge of your seat from the first scene of the movie to the last. The two main characters they follow in the movie is Rocket a boy who does not have passion for the crime life in Rio de Janeiro and the other named Lil Ze who takes the opposite path and becomes a drug dealer. They grew up together when they were young but took completely different paths in their life. The movie does a great job of giving the full story and of all of the different characters in the movie. The movie gives a full backstory and tells the story in only a 2-hour movie which could have been at least 3 with all of the detail and story going into the movie. The details that they show in the movie is so fine that there is not an object out of place. City of God had a lot of mise-en-scene with the placement of a poster or a person in the background. Each shot has important lighting in it like during the dance there are flashing light to show the confusing that is going on during the scene. Also, the scene in the hotel room with the little kid with the blood all over the walls and the pattern of the blood. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes movies that will keep you interested and keep you wanting more. I give this movie an 8/10 and would watch it again to find more details that went into the movie."
A real image of brazillian favelas portrait in a genious cinematic view,denypub,21 March 2019,10,"It's amazing how most part of the cast is actual poor people from the real community of Cidade de Deus. They act with such naturalism that makes some of the critiques not take then as relatable. Same as their desumanized behavor. True is that thats the reality in the favelas of the Rio de Janeiro. And if its too hard, too desensetized for you. It should be. And if its unrelatable, its a problem in the audience."
FOGO,wmasheter,10 January 2018,,One of the best movies of the millennia. Knowing Portuguese really helps understand the perect dialouge that gives the viewer a real feel for the Rio de Janeiro culture
Excellent movie,bhijanneupane,15 January 2018,,This is the best movie ever made. I ought to congratulate all the team for giving us this very nice movie.
Amazing Film,livelikekingx,23 January 2018,10,I love the concept. This film is one of my absolute favorites. I love the fact that everything was seen through the eyes of multiple characters all while being narrated by the director of the film. He did a great job explaining how they grew up.

I was wonderin because a few events, like Knockout Ned's killer happening to be the son of the guy he killed in the bank, (coincidentally linking it with the point where Ned loses his compunction for killing, making him no worse than Li'l Ze, and therefore propping up the circle of violence.) This seems too dramatically important. I mean some beautiful points were made, but it seems they are made poignant only by placement in the film, not by their content."
Brutal and unforgiving,twilightsamuraiboy,15 February 2006,,"I just saw this new documentary called ""Favela Rising"" that seemed to be inspired by Fernando Meirelles' powerful and trenchant ""City of God"". What impressed me about ""City of God"" was both its urgent social realism and its vibrant, propulsive energy. While the film's stark yet colorful images arrest you, Meirelles' handling of the issues besetting Brazil's slums -- from poverty, lack of access to education and social services, that escalate to violence and the drug trade -- is complex and responsible, but without being preachy. The main character Rocket's camera (apparently representing Meirelles' own lens) seemed to be an impartial witness to the proceedings and thus the violence becomes even more brutal and devastating because it seemed endemic and thoughtless, coming from the film's characters. The name ""Ciudade de Dios"", the favela where the interweaving narratives in this film are set, could be no further from the truth of the realities in that community."
An absolutely amazing film!,aicw2,10 February 2006,10,"Watched it last night and though it was an incredible and powerful piece of cinema. I'd heard a review of it that likened it to a Brazilian Goodfellas and that is about right. The cinematography has exciting pace and it is superbly directed. The film has many separate strands that all intertwine very creatively. There were some truly disturbing scenes in this film, mainly the ones involving young children as killers or victims. However it is an effective portrait of life in that environment and it is very powerfully conveyed. Another film that it is similar to is Boyz In The Hood although I preferred this one. A must see!"
a must see movie,nenen34,14 February 2006,9,"I saw the movie yesterday it was fantastic.. it had you sitting at the edge of your seat!.. i felt as if i was actually living there and going through what everyone else was going through...Trying not to get killed and surviving.... being so young and realizing the only way to live everyday was to learn the streets. and to always keep your eyes and ears open... you also had to be aware of who was your friend or a foe. it was mind exploding in how easy it was to be a friend or easier to become an enemy by being in the wrong place or time.. when watching the movie, you must pay attention to everything to understand the trail of events"
One of the best movies Ive ever seen,federicoedelstein,6 March 2019,10,"This movie is a journey though the brazilian fabella, from the point of view of a more passive spectator of the facts that happen. Increíble memorable characters, excelent directon and everything about it is perfect"
AMAZING,biancalominy,22 November 2018,10,This film was introduced to me while in HS and as an adult it still resonates. One of the best films I have ever seen from the cinematography to the story line and more. Please watch.
Glorious Raw,shubhufreesouls,27 November 2018,10,"The beauty is in its detailing and its rawness. Awesome screenplay treated in the best manner and captured with its all rawness gloriously. Fan of this masterpiece, kudos to its director and whole cast & crew.."
